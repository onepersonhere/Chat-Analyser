There will be 3 prayer periods, at the start, mid and end of the hungry ghost festival. Thus, the money contributed will be divided into the 3. It is a tradition that has been practiced in rrrc for a long time to pray for our protection and well-being. You can contribute how much you want to, just note that the more you contribute, the more food we can eat. For those with religious belief, you do not have to join in the prayers but you still can contribute for the food that we can all eat later.

For people traveling to China for a short period of time, including tourists, they can get a temporary driver‚Äôs permit for a maximum of three months without needing to pass an exam. Normally, you can obtain this at the traffic police department (ËΩ¶ÁÆ°ÊâÄ) in the city you are in. In Beijing and possibly in other large cities, it can be¬†obtained directly in the airport.
Necessary documents:

National driver‚Äôs license.

International Driving Permit.

Chinese translation of the foreign driver‚Äôs license (consult the embassy to know where this can be done).

Completed application form.

A hotel booking for at least one day.

Three one-inch color photos with a white background.

24/08/2020, 21:28 - Wh: I recommend taking the train from Xining for 2 main reasons. Xining, capital of Qinghai province and the largest city on the Tibetan Plateau, is the actual starting point of the Tibetan Railway. It lies at an elevation of 2275m and is a good place to spend a couple of nights at in order to acclimatize to the higher elevation of Lhasa. Spending a couple of nights in Xining will reduce (but NOT eliminate)¬†the chances of getting serious altitude sickness. Another reason why I recommend taking the train to Lhasa from Xining is that it is generally easier to get train tickets in Xining. Unlike the other cities that have trains originating to Lhasa, Xining is a small city by Chinese standards. The smaller population means that fewer people are trying to get tickets on the coveted Lhasa Train. It can still be difficult to get train tickets to Lhasa from Xining during the peak high season, but not as difficult as Chengdu, Beijing, Shanghai or any other larger city.

06/09/2020, 21:40 - Wh: I'm from HK and I think you're a bit harsh on HKers. The conditions for HK Youth is shit, and the government doesn't do much about it. Things like housing price, living cost, rich-poor divide, they are among the top of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

That leads to many young people thinking the grass is greener on another side, and of course, Murica perfectly took advantage of that, so the protesters instead of protesting what actually made their lives hell, protested against some law no one cares about and that's what you end up with.

&amp;#x200B;

I know many pro-protesters on LIHKG who worship America, tend to be those that have never been to the West. Those that had, will usually have something bad to say about it, racism, discrimination, bad metro system etc.

06/09/2020, 22:32 - Tan Xin Kai: Thought is the person has to write haha
06/09/2020, 22:32 - Peiran: That's usually what some COU units do, they got one month no training for them to take leave
06/09/2020, 22:32 - Tan Xin Kai: Of course the unit wouldn't want to cause so much trouble
06/09/2020, 22:32 - Tan Xin Kai: Oh...

06/09/2020, 22:53 - Tan Xin Kai: Yes... Let's hope for better situation in the future
06/09/2020, 22:54 - Peiran: Overseas travel will be allowed otherwise the airline industry will collapse
06/09/2020, 22:54 - Peiran: With the government investing more on airport
06/09/2020, 22:54 - Tan Xin Kai: Albeit selectively
06/09/2020, 22:55 - Tan Xin Kai: And more caution needed to avoid more infections due to increase in exposure risks
06/09/2020, 22:55 - Peiran: The most affected are those taking O and A levels this year

07/09/2020, 15:41 - Tan Xin Kai: Only prioritised on frontline workers or contracters
07/09/2020, 15:41 - Tan Xin Kai: Maybe they don't wanna subsidize?
07/09/2020, 15:42 - Peiran: For SG to get the resources for all residents shouldn't be a big problem

07/09/2020, 15:43 - Peiran: And that's a big problem
07/09/2020, 15:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea man
07/09/2020, 15:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Since the beginning
07/09/2020, 15:44 - Peiran: Because here if they don't work they will earn no money
07/09/2020, 15:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Plus delays in developments too
07/09/2020, 15:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Construction etc
07/09/2020, 15:44 - Peiran: If they locked the border and get mass testing there won't even be CB
07/09/2020, 15:45 - Peiran: They are the lowest class in the whole hierarchy of economics so it doesn't justify to punish them also
07/09/2020, 15:45 - Peiran: Which is what happens in US
07/09/2020, 15:45 - Tan Xin Kai: Cus if not wrong, I remembered that time... Lockdown was a sensitive wording that the gov wanna restraint from using... As they at the start said they won't go to lockdown stage
07/09/2020, 15:46 - Peiran: They cannot afford to lock down the country
07/09/2020, 15:46 - Tan Xin Kai: True that lockdowns affect those at the lower end of the working class
07/09/2020, 15:47 - Peiran: If they do that the economy will cripple in 5 days
07/09/2020, 15:47 - Tan Xin Kai: Hmm maybe can ask the gov why they don't wanna do mass testing
07/09/2020, 15:47 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
07/09/2020, 15:47 - Peiran: Controlling imported cases is much easier than controlling community spread
07/09/2020, 15:48 - Tan Xin Kai: Stopping it at the doorstep
07/09/2020, 15:48 - Peiran: They don't want to take the risk
07/09/2020, 15:48 - Tan Xin Kai: Of revealing the true numbers of cases?
07/09/2020, 15:48 - Peiran: By then they validated the risk to be low so no need to do that
07/09/2020, 15:49 - Peiran: But they couldn't realise things have gone too far
07/09/2020, 15:49 - Peiran: They need to control social security also
07/09/2020, 15:49 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea esp when even PM actually admitted that their fault was at not reacting to the fact that covid can spread asymptomatically
07/09/2020, 15:49 - Peiran: Cannot let people panic
07/09/2020, 15:50 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea man.. psychology... Would rather impose a cb in the hopes of letting the community cases starve out
07/09/2020, 15:50 - Peiran: Whichever way they do they will still suffer
The government had a hard time deciding it also
07/09/2020, 15:50 - Peiran: I started wearing mask before CNY already
07/09/2020, 15:51 - Tan Xin Kai: That's way early haha
07/09/2020, 15:51 - Peiran: Ask your China friends most of them were doing that
07/09/2020, 15:51 - Tan Xin Kai: When it hits all of a sudden, it's kinda hard to decide what's the best for the society
07/09/2020, 15:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea man
07/09/2020, 15:52 - Peiran: My hostel closed the study rooms before Wuhan got locked down
07/09/2020, 15:52 - Peiran: Until now don't want to open

07/09/2020, 15:53 - Tan Xin Kai: Wow.... That's like not taking any single risk

07/09/2020, 15:54 - Wh: You want dinner tmr ?
07/09/2020, 15:54 - Tan Xin Kai: Maybe they wanna close it to lower cleaning cost.... But say it as though it's to prevent covid spread
07/09/2020, 15:54 - Peiran: That's the only place that has aircon in the hostel
07/09/2020, 15:54 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea lower operational costs
07/09/2020, 15:54 - Tan Xin Kai: Wen Han being very appropriate
07/09/2020, 15:55 - Peiran: I'm not surprised if they shut down wifi also
07/09/2020, 15:55 - Tan Xin Kai: That's bad

07/09/2020, 16:49 - Peiran: The earth doesn't need human beings to save
07/09/2020, 16:49 - Tan Xin Kai: Funny how they only concerned about food wastage on paper... Like the paperwork must be food collected must almost equate food indented
07/09/2020, 16:50 - Peiran: Unless you got some methods to stop the earth being hit by asteroids or engulfed by the sun at its red supergiant phase
07/09/2020, 16:50 - Tan Xin Kai: So technically it's a large loophole... U could have ordered 100x, and only have 20x eaten, then u scan 80x as outration
07/09/2020, 16:50 - Tan Xin Kai: At the end of the day it's considered no wastage
07/09/2020, 16:50 - Peiran: Then in the end they wasted 80 more
07/09/2020, 16:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea but they don't care.... Only care about audit for their paperwork
07/09/2020, 16:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Everything nice nice can alr

07/09/2020, 16:53 - Peiran: Then when you eat they will say cannot waste food
07/09/2020, 16:53 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
07/09/2020, 16:53 - Tan Xin Kai: But it's kinda true that they have to enforce u at least eat something like else it's against human rights to not give food
07/09/2020, 16:53 - Peiran: They don't fear the army people complain but rather the public
07/09/2020, 16:54 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea man
07/09/2020, 16:54 - Tan Xin Kai: Just look at my enciks scared of recs parents complain

07/09/2020, 16:55 - Tan Xin Kai: Mindef is immune from being sued
07/09/2020, 16:55 - Peiran: Even if he admit full responsibility the army will still be the one being screwed
07/09/2020, 16:56 - Peiran: There is no contract in assuming responsibilities in army esp in terms of safety
07/09/2020, 16:57 - Peiran: You running during PT and fall down they will ask why the specs never ensure safety instead of asking why you never watch the road
07/09/2020, 16:59 - Peiran: Not everything with cause-effect relationships bears the equal responsibility
07/09/2020, 17:06 - Tan Xin Kai: Always blaming the higher ranks

You‚Äôll get the idea if you go through my post history but yeah, some SOB basically nearly ran me over with his bike - it was very intentional as he saw me walking from way afar and when he flew past me I yelled after him what his problem was and he told me explicitly to f*ck off ch*nk. White guy in smart suit to me, shortish Asian female. 

Having encounters like this doesn‚Äôt get easier and I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I bawled my eyes out when I got home but now, I‚Äôm just angry and tired. I‚Äôm also worried for my parents - if they are like this to me, I worry what might happen to them who are not fluent in English and may not be able to fight their way out of such situations.

But yeah, fuck London and fuck the UK.

Side note, I‚Äôm so grateful for this subreddit and to know we have such a place to come together and support or rant or whatever may be.

16/10/2020, 20:06 - Peiran: If you can buy a house for that price no one will rent your house
16/10/2020, 20:07 - Wh: You need to see the location
16/10/2020, 20:07 - Peiran: And all your profits are eroded by taxes and other contract maintenance fees

16/10/2020, 20:09 - Wh: No such thing unless you are in china
16/10/2020, 20:09 - Peiran: Bankrupt doesn't mean you don't need to pay back the money you owe

16/10/2020, 20:14 - Wh: I think its shipping or smth
16/10/2020, 20:14 - Peiran: SG is a free trade hub doesn't mean it got no credit system
16/10/2020, 20:15 - Wh: The credit system is skewed to favour investors
16/10/2020, 20:15 - Wh: Thats why there is so many FDI in singapore
16/10/2020, 20:15 - Wh: So those banks are taking high risks when issuing loans
16/10/2020, 20:15 - Wh: But the returns are greater than risks
16/10/2020, 20:15 - Peiran: Which is why SG incubated a lot of financial crimes
16/10/2020, 20:17 - Peiran: This is the same as I buy a car but I say I got no money but I'm going to sell it and I use the sales money to pay back
16/10/2020, 20:17 - Wh: Thats not a crime
16/10/2020, 20:17 - Wh: Thats totally legal
16/10/2020, 20:17 - Wh: You can make money from that
16/10/2020, 20:17 - Peiran: But if you are the car dealer you won't sell him the car
16/10/2020, 20:17 - Wh: But cars are depreciating so no body does that
16/10/2020, 20:18 - Wh: @6587909929 you jealous?
16/10/2020, 20:18 - Peiran: Because you got no principal assets how I know whether you have money to pay back
16/10/2020, 20:19 - Wh: Haha doesn't mean they won't lend
16/10/2020, 20:19 - Wh: Its called venture capital and its high risk

07/11/2020, 07:03 - Wh: Edit: This sub might not be the place for US-China geopolitical shit like this, but I'll leave this up anyways since I think it's important for people to know that much of the current Sinophobia is (or was, if the Biden administration's stance is any different) coming from a crazed individual.

Here's a quick breakdown of the Trump Administration's stance on Taiwan.

The devil on Trump's shoulder is **Matt Pottinger,** Deputy National Security Advisor. Even though he's a step below National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Pottinger is clearly at the steering wheel regarding anti-China policy since he's "fluent" in Mandarin and has some journalistic experience in China. Pottinger is basically an anti-China zealot who has done a number of pretty evil things in the past few years. To preface, he was in charge of the American COVID task force from January to February before it was transferred to Pence and his team, and instead of learning as much as he could from China and mobilizing a trace-and-isolate strategy, he basically turned all his attention to finding ways to blame China instead, which spawned the cover-up narrative. Basically, he considered it a worthy sacrifice for hundreds of thousands of Americans to die if it meant crystallizing anti-China sentiment for a generation. He is also the one who coined and [pushed for the spread of the term "Wuhan Virus"](https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/other/trump-adviser-matthew-pottinger-takes-soft-approach-to-promoting-democracy-in-china-on-may-fourth-movement-anniversary/ar-BB13AZn3) and "China Virus" in mainstream media. He's also the one who [pushed hard for the Wuhan Lab origin theory](https://news.yahoo.com/intelligence-officials-weigh-possibility-coronavirus-escaped-from-a-chinese-lab-194958353.html). It's all him. I don't know if you remember the Chinese-American Stanford professor on a short list for Nobel Prize consideration who committed suicide due to US government pressure, but that's Pottinger's doing as well.

Taiwan is just another geopolitical pawn for Pottinger. With regards to Taiwan, he [pushed for a massive arms sale to them to drive geopolitical tension](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/us/politics/us-arms-sale-taiwan-china.html) and he was the one behind the whole US pulling funding from and withdrawing from the WHO fiasco, citing their refusal to recognize Taiwan (even though it's a UN issue, not a WHO one). Basically, he's just feigning support in order to use them as puppets to piss off China. I guess young Taiwanese don't realize that.

_Additionally, the authorities will increase capacity limits for venues. For malls and large standalone stores, the capacity limit will be increased from 10 square metres per person to eight square metres per person._

15/12/2020, 11:29 - Tan Xin Kai: Ohh
15/12/2020, 11:31 - Peiran: From the information above we can see an increase in the flow of customers, with the noticeable 25% increase in customer capacity. As projected this will mean more people coming to the stores, increase in demand and eventually increase in revenue (insert DS diagram)
15/12/2020, 11:32 - Wh: Thats xk I got As for days
15/12/2020, 11:34 - Peiran: However we need to know the demand is not dependant only on the capacity. We need to count into the willingness to buy, which is largely dependent on the income of people. As seen before with the 30-40% downfall in economy and unemployment, many won't have the willingness to buy more goods and this will somehow hinder the growth of revenue for the store owners.
15/12/2020, 11:35 - Wh: Lol
15/12/2020, 11:36 - Wh: Econs
15/12/2020, 11:37 - Tan Xin Kai: Good haha
15/12/2020, 11:38 - Tan Xin Kai: Making our brain think during NS brain rot period
15/12/2020, 11:38 - Peiran: There is this term called 'revenge consumption' which means after long periods of lockdown etc. people will buy more on impulse and the scale will be bigger then projected. Hence we need to be aware of traffic jam, controlling of large crowds and other safety measures which still can decrease their growth of revenue. Nevertheless as phase 3 is coming people have a more positive mindset and feel safer to go to different stores, it is still realistic to say both the consumers and the store owners will enjoy benefits which pulls up the growth and recovery of SG economy.

15/12/2020, 17:25 - Peiran: That's why I choose the eastern route, the traffic is better
15/12/2020, 17:25 - Tan Xin Kai: What my fam would say too
15/12/2020, 17:25 - Tan Xin Kai: How's the plan like
15/12/2020, 17:25 - Tan Xin Kai: Eastern?
15/12/2020, 17:25 - Peiran: Travelling within the whole China within 30 days with full exposure is not possible
15/12/2020, 17:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea very true
15/12/2020, 17:26 - Tan Xin Kai: We can focus on one part
15/12/2020, 17:26 - Peiran: Mainly based on my travel experiences 
Some of the places I went there before so at least I have a sense of where to go
15/12/2020, 17:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Also this needs to be dependant on travel rules then
15/12/2020, 17:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Ohh sounds good to have a local recommend
15/12/2020, 17:27 - Peiran: That will be NE, ME, ESE and SE part
15/12/2020, 17:27 - Peiran: Only place you have a local guide is Harbin
15/12/2020, 17:27 - Peiran: And Beijing where Wh can ask his relatives to guide
15/12/2020, 17:27 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
15/12/2020, 17:27 - Peiran: But I'm sure wh alone also won't know where is where
15/12/2020, 17:28 - Tan Xin Kai: Your hometown
15/12/2020, 17:28 - Peiran: Also mode of transit we try to utilize public transport as priority
15/12/2020, 17:28 - Tan Xin Kai: How's Harbin in May

15/12/2020, 17:30 - Peiran: And food wise you don't have to pay
15/12/2020, 17:30 - Wh: True
15/12/2020, 17:30 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
15/12/2020, 17:30 - Wh: You can fish for your own food
15/12/2020, 17:30 - Peiran: Something like that
But not that drastic like Tibet

15/12/2020, 17:30 - Tan Xin Kai: Idk abt now
15/12/2020, 17:30 - Wh: Its called backpacking
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Tan Xin Kai: Wow
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Tan Xin Kai: But it's dry air right
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Peiran: That one I will make a force prep list
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Tan Xin Kai: Yes sgt
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Peiran: Lol
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Peiran: Lol
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Peiran: <Media omitted>
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Tan Xin Kai: <Media omitted>
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Tan Xin Kai: <Media omitted>
15/12/2020, 17:31 - Peiran: Lol
15/12/2020, 17:32 - Peiran: But in case you want to bring local goods or food or something back you need some space
15/12/2020, 17:32 - Peiran: Esp a lot of stores don't support overseas shipping
15/12/2020, 17:33 - Peiran: But to be honest no need to buy
Go on taobao you can buy anything from there
15/12/2020, 17:33 - Tan Xin Kai: Ohh
15/12/2020, 17:33 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha easy and simple
15/12/2020, 17:33 - Peiran: Want to eat the food and eat on the spot
That's the point
A lot of streets food cannot find elsewhere
15/12/2020, 17:33 - Tan Xin Kai: Maybe a bit only bah
15/12/2020, 17:34 - Peiran: That's why
15/12/2020, 17:35 - Peiran: Secondly this is not a shopping trip
15/12/2020, 17:35 - Peiran: Not like you bring 5 empty luggage to stock pile stuff
15/12/2020, 17:35 - Peiran: Plus I don't think anyone here stupid to do that
Got no point
15/12/2020, 17:36 - Peiran: Only happens before 2015 for Chinese tourists buying stuff in Japan like crazy
15/12/2020, 17:36 - Tan Xin Kai: Nah I won't do that haha
15/12/2020, 17:37 - Tan Xin Kai: Wow
15/12/2020, 17:37 - Tan Xin Kai: Our personalities aren't the type to splurge crazily on shipping trips
15/12/2020, 17:38 - Wh: Well nope
15/12/2020, 17:39 - Peiran: These are the places on the shortlist:
Harbin
Shenyang
Beijing Tianjin 
Qingdao
Nanjing Shanghai
Hangzhou
Guangzhou
15/12/2020, 17:39 - Tan Xin Kai: WH do u have leave next yeae
15/12/2020, 17:39 - Tan Xin Kai: Year
15/12/2020, 17:39 - Peiran: That will be well enough for 14 days
15/12/2020, 17:39 - Peiran: Just take some will be fine
15/12/2020, 17:40 - Tan Xin Kai: Sounds quite a spread
15/12/2020, 17:40 - Peiran: Don't buy sausages at my place though
You want I next time bring you when school starts
15/12/2020, 17:40 - Tan Xin Kai: Why haha
15/12/2020, 17:40 - Tan Xin Kai: U can share with us knowledge abt what's tourists traps haha
15/12/2020, 17:40 - Peiran: Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou is a must go
15/12/2020, 17:41 - Peiran: That one is usually inside tourist spots where they sell the stuff expensive af
15/12/2020, 17:41 - Tan Xin Kai: All the major cities right
15/12/2020, 17:41 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
15/12/2020, 17:41 - Peiran: Esp in the Western areas
15/12/2020, 17:42 - Tan Xin Kai: But those places wanna self-explore or guided
15/12/2020, 17:42 - Peiran: Since it's your first time going to China we show you the metropolis style first
15/12/2020, 17:42 - Tan Xin Kai: If it's even possible for me to go China in the first place then haha
15/12/2020, 17:42 - Tan Xin Kai: Ohh
15/12/2020, 17:42 - Tan Xin Kai: I'm more of nature person
15/12/2020, 17:42 - Peiran: December or in the future if you come I got a mid-western route also
15/12/2020, 17:43 - Peiran: Then you will see a totally different Chinese scenery
15/12/2020, 17:43 - Peiran: Those big cities got more modes of travel also
15/12/2020, 17:43 - Peiran: Easier for this time when travel hasn't been out of restriction first
15/12/2020, 17:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Wahh
15/12/2020, 17:44 - Tan Xin Kai: True
15/12/2020, 17:44 - Peiran: Plus
Some of the places no need to book tour
Because group pour hasn't been fully opened
Inside big cities at least we know where is where
15/12/2020, 17:45 - Tan Xin Kai: Covid really wreak our plans
15/12/2020, 17:45 - Tan Xin Kai: I see
15/12/2020, 17:45 - Peiran: Exactly 
Otherwise I can go back home twice this year
15/12/2020, 17:45 - Tan Xin Kai: Ikr
15/12/2020, 17:46 - Tan Xin Kai: Ended up our Year end leaves only can stay in SG
15/12/2020, 17:46 - Tan Xin Kai: Which is not my plan at all
15/12/2020, 17:47 - Peiran: And mostly the mode of travel is by train
Harbin to Shenyang is 3 hours
Shenyang to Being is 2 hours 
Beijing to Tianjin can take bus
Then to Qingdao around 4 hours 
From Qingdao take plane to Shanghai 2 hours
Then rest can take by train
15/12/2020, 17:47 - Peiran: Lol
15/12/2020, 17:47 - Tan Xin Kai: Ohhh
15/12/2020, 17:47 - Tan Xin Kai: I see
15/12/2020, 17:47 - Peiran: Plus the idea of wh asking me to drive all the way
My point is I don't drive outside Harbin
15/12/2020, 17:48 - Peiran: Don't know what's their road condition is and where is where
15/12/2020, 17:48 - Tan Xin Kai: It's too risky and waste of time and fuel
15/12/2020, 17:48 - Peiran: Gena traffic accident also very problematic
15/12/2020, 17:48 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea man
15/12/2020, 17:49 - Peiran: Got MRT in all those cities 
That's why I choose those places
15/12/2020, 17:50 - Tan Xin Kai: Ahhh
15/12/2020, 17:50 - Peiran: Another route is Xi'an Chengdu Chonging Wuhan etc
15/12/2020, 17:50 - Tan Xin Kai: Public Transport cheaper
15/12/2020, 17:50 - Peiran: More natural sceneries
15/12/2020, 17:50 - Tan Xin Kai: Wahh
15/12/2020, 17:50 - Peiran: Exactly 
Go to those Western parts we will need to book guided tour
15/12/2020, 17:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Like what WH mentioned as Urumqi Tibet right
15/12/2020, 17:54 - Wh: Yes
15/12/2020, 17:54 - Peiran: Xinjiang Tibet and Yunnan is a separate route
15/12/2020, 17:55 - Peiran: That one without guide very difficult to travel
15/12/2020, 17:55 - Tan Xin Kai: I can picture the route
15/12/2020, 17:55 - Tan Xin Kai: It's more rural and where transport is hard to get by
15/12/2020, 17:56 - Peiran: Yes rural part is a must see for tourism 
But we need to consider modes of travel also
15/12/2020, 17:56 - Peiran: I don't trust my driving skills inside mountains
15/12/2020, 18:00 - Tan Xin Kai: Mountain roads are challenged
15/12/2020, 18:00 - Tan Xin Kai: Challenging
15/12/2020, 18:01 - Peiran: Whatever we do we prioritize safety
15/12/2020, 18:01 - Peiran: I won't sacrifice safety for cost though
15/12/2020, 18:03 - Peiran: Also the next thing is food
Nothing called to save cost eat KFC all the way
15/12/2020, 18:04 - Tan Xin Kai: Yes agree
15/12/2020, 18:04 - Tan Xin Kai: Ikr that way of 'saving' might as well stay at home at eat KFC all day
15/12/2020, 18:05 - Peiran: Might as well just sleep all day
15/12/2020, 18:05 - Tan Xin Kai: Think we'll just continue to see how the travel restrictions and rules turn out when nearing May 2021
15/12/2020, 18:05 - Tan Xin Kai: Hopefully Vaccinations will be able to help a bit
15/12/2020, 18:05 - Peiran: Plus can order delivery and it's very fast
15/12/2020, 18:05 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
15/12/2020, 18:06 - Tan Xin Kai: Just VR headset travel can alr if just kfc
15/12/2020, 18:06 - Peiran: Lol
15/12/2020, 18:06 - Peiran: Just play GTA if want to go US
15/12/2020, 18:06 - Peiran: Plus they got no food rather than junk food
15/12/2020, 18:06 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol can also practice virtual mountain roads driving
15/12/2020, 18:07 - Peiran: "Sword art online"
15/12/2020, 18:07 - Peiran: That's why say must travel to China
15/12/2020, 18:07 - Peiran: Because food cannot be replaced using VR
15/12/2020, 18:08 - Peiran: Everywhere else want to travel just google images
15/12/2020, 18:08 - Peiran: Must give you the sense of after you come back the whole SG food is crap
15/12/2020, 18:23 - Tan Xin Kai: Very true
15/12/2020, 18:23 - Tan Xin Kai: I alr knew that, haha
15/12/2020, 18:23 - Tan Xin Kai: It's very bad
15/12/2020, 18:24 - Tan Xin Kai: Like those at coffee shops standard very low... 'Soup' is just water used to boil the noodles, then just anyhow add ketchup when u say no chilli
15/12/2020, 18:24 - Tan Xin Kai: Really anyhow
15/12/2020, 18:27 - Peiran: Lol
15/12/2020, 18:27 - Peiran: Normal hawker centres cannot find good food
15/12/2020, 18:28 - Tan Xin Kai: Really blood boil the first time I said no chilli and they freakin like cooking baby food
15/12/2020, 18:28 - Tan Xin Kai: Ketchup on noodles is just pure blasphemy
15/12/2020, 18:28 - Tan Xin Kai: Ikr and sg still wanna say what good hawker food
15/12/2020, 18:29 - Tan Xin Kai: Mostly bad
15/12/2020, 18:34 - Peiran: Lol
15/12/2020, 18:34 - Peiran: These people should go and learn proper cooking techniques
15/12/2020, 18:34 - Tan Xin Kai: Like literal garbage
15/12/2020, 18:35 - Tan Xin Kai: It's just A + B and they think it's food
15/12/2020, 18:35 - Tan Xin Kai: Nah it's not all about formula
15/12/2020, 18:36 - Tan Xin Kai: Doesn't help when gov keep driving the idea of raising productivity using machines, where every thing is just formulated
15/12/2020, 18:36 - Tan Xin Kai: Sauce A + Vegetables + Cook 5min = Dish
15/12/2020, 18:36 - Tan Xin Kai: As though we are mass workers of company
15/12/2020, 18:39 - Peiran: What the heck
15/12/2020, 18:41 - Tan Xin Kai: Literally what our cookhouse does too
15/12/2020, 18:44 - Tan Xin Kai: They keep saying use their Productivity Innovations Solutions Grant (smth liddat) and invest on machines to churn out _food_ faster so as to get more profit
15/12/2020, 18:44 - Tan Xin Kai: So they mostly only care abt profits, neglecting the flavours of food itself
15/12/2020, 18:46 - Wh: Wah u guys still discussing ah?
15/12/2020, 20:43 - Wh: Thats why eat restraint
15/12/2020, 20:43 - Wh: U wondering how the rich live long

15/12/2020, 20:55 - Wh: Hawker food so unhealthy
15/12/2020, 20:55 - Wh: Plus you eat in unsanitary conditions
15/12/2020, 20:55 - Peiran: Just that you see they got no vegetables
15/12/2020, 20:56 - Peiran: Whenever I want to eat vegetables I must cook by myself
15/12/2020, 20:58 - Wh: Lol true
15/12/2020, 21:02 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
15/12/2020, 21:02 - Tan Xin Kai: Even a small piece of cucumber also they cut

24/12/2020, 14:48 - Peiran: You think its staycation

24/12/2020, 14:51 - Peiran: Very surprised that he only ate 6 plates if sushi at sushi Express last time
24/12/2020, 14:54 - Peiran: Based on the law of diminishing marginal utility the optimal point is 12 dishes 
From 12 to 16 still got benefit at increased decreasing rate
17 onwards will get negative gain and 25 is net benefit zero as well as never eat
24/12/2020, 14:56 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
24/12/2020, 14:56 - Tan Xin Kai: It's also called progressing towards satiation both mentally and physically
24/12/2020, 14:57 - Tan Xin Kai: Mentally - Am I eating too much, kinda sick of this
Physically - Or no I'm kinda getting full
24/12/2020, 14:57 - Peiran: Applies to any buffet
If you eat their chili crab only you may feel you earn back the bill
But actually your stomach pains more
24/12/2020, 14:57 - Tan Xin Kai: Hahaha
24/12/2020, 14:58 - Peiran: Always got this mindset 
I pay 50 for this so I must eat 100 bucks worth of food
24/12/2020, 15:02 - Tan Xin Kai: Actually it's not wrong to maximise the worth of the buffet, but need to be smart
24/12/2020, 15:03 - Peiran: Got one kid last time during buffet drink coke only
Now you think on this he's the real mvp
24/12/2020, 15:04 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol total opposite of expectations... But in his shoes, maybe all he wants is coke
24/12/2020, 15:04 - Wh: Wtf

24/12/2020, 15:05 - Tan Xin Kai: Your friend last time?

24/12/2020, 15:05 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol
24/12/2020, 15:06 - Peiran: That's where food waste comes from
24/12/2020, 15:06 - Peiran: Because people don't order what they eat 
They order the whole thing and choose what they eat
24/12/2020, 15:07 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea man
24/12/2020, 15:07 - Peiran: That's what my family do
We smuggle the leftover food back home

24/12/2020, 15:14 - Tan Xin Kai: Or at most some gonna be fed to the workers
24/12/2020, 15:15 - Peiran: Hygiene and health concerns 
Otherwise food waste in SG can be reduced to 1/6 as of now
24/12/2020, 15:16 - Peiran: And nowadays not a lot of people seems to know that saving is a good virtue while wasting is a sin
24/12/2020, 15:16 - Tan Xin Kai: Haiz
24/12/2020, 15:17 - Wh: Nope
24/12/2020, 15:18 - Tan Xin Kai: Hmm... Sounds like idea for the overseeing Gov to implement compulsory food and meal plans for all.. where everyone is subscribed to standard food amt according to age and diet and must finish all food, else will deduct credits
24/12/2020, 15:18 - Wh: That's called rationing
24/12/2020, 15:18 - Tan Xin Kai: Hail the almighty gov

24/12/2020, 15:19 - Wh: Free food and healthcare
24/12/2020, 15:19 - Wh: But at the cost of freedom
24/12/2020, 15:19 - Tan Xin Kai: Ironic that it wastes so much food
24/12/2020, 15:19 - Wh: And equality
24/12/2020, 15:19 - Peiran: Against free will of people 
Because they decide what to eat
24/12/2020, 15:20 - Peiran: Else all the restaurants and the whole F&B industry will collapse
24/12/2020, 15:20 - Tan Xin Kai: That's if the only goal is little food waste
24/12/2020, 15:21 - Peiran: Free food in terms of you must do work for them
Free healthcare also make people chaokeng
24/12/2020, 15:21 - Tan Xin Kai: Or rather gov buy over every single F&B and their workers and make them supply a certain amt of food with choices... Then let the ppl choose they meals they want in advance like a week. That means it's fixed for the whole of next week
24/12/2020, 15:21 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol
24/12/2020, 15:22 - Tan Xin Kai: Then can claim freedom of choice and max efficiency
24/12/2020, 15:22 - Peiran: In less than 3 days people will overthrow the government
24/12/2020, 15:22 - Tan Xin Kai: Hahaha

26/12/2020, 21:20 - Tan Xin Kai: Why tho
26/12/2020, 21:20 - Peiran: Plus how do they possibly check 
Viewing one's contact tracing records must seek permission from ministry of health and only if being placed on close contact of confirmed cases
26/12/2020, 21:20 - Tan Xin Kai: Does it mean no watching of movies outside if one is in uniform
26/12/2020, 21:21 - Peiran: No watching at all
26/12/2020, 21:21 - Tan Xin Kai: True... Unless they conduct a spotcheck
26/12/2020, 21:21 - Peiran: How they check though
26/12/2020, 21:21 - Peiran: From what I know they cannot anyhow check contact tracing records
26/12/2020, 21:22 - Peiran: And why they need to bother what we do outside
26/12/2020, 21:22 - Peiran: It's not against any law 
It doesn't makes navy look bad also
26/12/2020, 21:23 - Peiran: Their reason is cinemas got different safe measures
26/12/2020, 21:23 - Wh: Welcome to SAF
26/12/2020, 21:23 - Wh: Welcome to SNF
26/12/2020, 21:23 - Wh: Welcome to NS
26/12/2020, 21:23 - Peiran: Others they can say safety issues 
In what context can watching movies be a breach of safety
26/12/2020, 21:24 - Peiran: You awol also hot no DB
You watch movies 3 days DB
You think this makes sense or not
26/12/2020, 21:25 - Peiran: Not some stupid OC made this rule

26/12/2020, 21:26 - Peiran: Lol

26/12/2020, 21:32 - Peiran: Technically speaking if want to give formal punishment you have the rights to refuse
Can just say the rule is against justice
26/12/2020, 21:32 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
26/12/2020, 21:33 - Peiran: Lol
26/12/2020, 21:33 - Peiran: Not so many stuff in SAF are 100% dumb though
26/12/2020, 21:33 - Tan Xin Kai: Then by that line of logic, malls and outside establishments like restaurants, events also all have various and different safety measures mahh
26/12/2020, 21:34 - Peiran: Exactly
26/12/2020, 21:34 - Tan Xin Kai: So it's just an order by the RSN ah
26/12/2020, 21:34 - Tan Xin Kai: Is it RSN wide
26/12/2020, 21:34 - Peiran: That's the same logic as if you book out you are exposed to risk so in order to mini6the risk you don't book out until ord
26/12/2020, 21:35 - Peiran: Our brigade
26/12/2020, 21:35 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol
26/12/2020, 21:36 - Tan Xin Kai: If u ban movie watching at cinema... Then how about those attending prayers or those mass congregations events
26/12/2020, 21:36 - Tan Xin Kai: Isn't it more crowded
26/12/2020, 21:36 - Peiran: Don't let them infiltrate your personal life
26/12/2020, 21:37 - Peiran: They won't make that rule
Otherwise second day there will be a whole group bombing the whole camp
26/12/2020, 21:37 - Peiran: Religious harmony is something even the government cannot touch
26/12/2020, 21:38 - Tan Xin Kai: That's why see
26/12/2020, 21:38 - Tan Xin Kai: If only they know what is work and what is personal life
26/12/2020, 21:39 - Peiran: Confirm be like brigade chief watch movies outside then got beaten by his wife
Then he drank 10L alcohol then made this rule
26/12/2020, 21:39 - Tan Xin Kai: Right of personal freewill to do whatever that's perfectly legal outside camp should also be adhered to
26/12/2020, 21:39 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol
26/12/2020, 21:39 - Tan Xin Kai: The specific ban on movie watching is sus tho
26/12/2020, 21:39 - Peiran: Exactly 
Watch movies also adhere to safety measures what
26/12/2020, 21:40 - Peiran: This is the same as finding trouble for themselves
26/12/2020, 21:41 - Peiran: Fellas can just mc all the way and say got mental issues
26/12/2020, 21:41 - Tan Xin Kai: Unless they tryna say that Gov allows cinema to operate at less than standard safety measures, if that is what they trying to insinuate
26/12/2020, 21:41 - Peiran: Doctor my personal life is being threatened
26/12/2020, 21:41 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
26/12/2020, 21:42 - Tan Xin Kai: _Movie is my life_ and _they tryna ban me, cancel me ü•∫_
26/12/2020, 21:42 - Peiran: That one doesn't make sense 
Like that bigger problem because the government is failing its role
26/12/2020, 21:42 - Peiran: Lol
26/12/2020, 21:42 - Tan Xin Kai: That's why it doesn't make sense... As tho rsn brigade don't trust the gov to enforce its rules
26/12/2020, 21:43 - Peiran: I heard from people here
They never send official documents stating this
26/12/2020, 21:43 - Tan Xin Kai: Ohh

26/12/2020, 22:27 - Peiran: Means if you see crimes and never report it's not your fault
26/12/2020, 22:27 - Wh: This makes you suspicious
26/12/2020, 22:27 - Wh: He is the imposter amoung us

26/12/2020, 22:29 - Peiran: Only if wh is a police officer
26/12/2020, 22:29 - Peiran: From what I know MP have very little power outside military context
They at most can refer to SPF only
26/12/2020, 22:30 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
26/12/2020, 22:30 - Tan Xin Kai: Outside military is no longer their scope
26/12/2020, 22:31 - Peiran: MPs can only search and arrest civilians when approved by SPF and Mindef chiefs
26/12/2020, 22:32 - Peiran: You wearing your own clothes even more dangerous because the one you arrest don't know who you are
They will just fight back
26/12/2020, 22:33 - Wh: Well MP are dangerous
26/12/2020, 22:33 - Wh: They shouldn't even exist in the first place

They are there to protect people
26/12/2020, 22:36 - Peiran: Like those kindergarten reading books
Bad kids will be caught by police
That mindset is totally wrong
26/12/2020, 22:37 - Wh: Nope

Cannot be harm people in the words of protecting their reputation
26/12/2020, 22:42 - Peiran: Just think of this case
A recruit wearing uniform booking out and saw gangsters using parang hitting people 
He went up and saved the victim but also got his uniform teared like fk
Question: if you are the unit MP should you reprimand or praise the recruit
26/12/2020, 22:43 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha Asian scare tactics 101
26/12/2020, 22:43 - Peiran: Lol

Their cops won't hesitate to shoot the whole magazine
26/12/2020, 22:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Worse still say some other races will catch those naughty kids
26/12/2020, 22:44 - Peiran: Lol
26/12/2020, 22:45 - Peiran: Anyone whose mind are normal will praise
Because that serves the bigger purpose 
People will think SAF is protecting people more than loutish gangs wearing improper uniform
26/12/2020, 22:47 - Tan Xin Kai: Hmm

29/12/2020, 21:45 - Wh: Then work for 3 years before migrating to canada
29/12/2020, 21:46 - Wh: Uni teach different stuff
29/12/2020, 21:46 - Wh: Our A level knowledge is basically useless
29/12/2020, 21:46 - Peiran: You know what
Apply for SEP to Canada or do one summer school there
29/12/2020, 21:46 - Wh: Then?
29/12/2020, 21:46 - Wh: Doesn't solve my problem
29/12/2020, 21:47 - Peiran: You can have a look at their country and education
29/12/2020, 21:47 - Peiran: Then better for you to decide
29/12/2020, 21:47 - Peiran: But to be honest 
If you want to find job easier in Canada then you should do your uni there
29/12/2020, 21:48 - Wh: Hard to do so
29/12/2020, 21:48 - Peiran: Lol
29/12/2020, 21:48 - Wh: Especially with my A level results not recognised there
29/12/2020, 21:48 - Wh: Basically our result is useless overseas
29/12/2020, 21:48 - Wh: Should have really done IB
29/12/2020, 21:48 - Peiran: If you have the determination to do so you would've applied 2 years ago
29/12/2020, 21:49 - Wh: How did I know I hate NS so much that I want to migrate
29/12/2020, 21:49 - Wh: You can't predict this
29/12/2020, 21:49 - Peiran: Who say one
I got a lot of seniors going to overseas uni using A levels
29/12/2020, 21:49 - Wh: Nope

29/12/2020, 21:49 - Wh: Extra exams
29/12/2020, 21:49 - Wh: Well our A levels is useless
29/12/2020, 21:49 - Peiran: Look at your vocation 
If you are in my unit you might kill yourself 1 year before
29/12/2020, 21:49 - Peiran: Lol

29/12/2020, 21:50 - Wh: I probably take MC all the way
29/12/2020, 21:50 - Peiran: You need to have your high school diploma first

29/12/2020, 21:50 - Wh: Whats high school
29/12/2020, 21:50 - Peiran: Otherwise no one will go JC and straight away study SAT ACT etc after sec school
29/12/2020, 21:50 - Peiran: JC poly equivalent
29/12/2020, 21:51 - Wh: Actually u can do that
29/12/2020, 21:51 - Wh: If I know SAT is a thing I wouldn't even do A level
29/12/2020, 21:51 - Peiran: Usually they won't recognize
29/12/2020, 21:51 - Wh: I would just take SAT and apply direct to US uni
29/12/2020, 21:51 - Wh: Then I say goodbye to NS
29/12/2020, 21:51 - Peiran: They still need your high school records what

29/12/2020, 21:51 - Wh: Sec school also have CV

29/12/2020, 21:53 - Wh: ^^^
29/12/2020, 21:53 - Peiran: I heard stories but I never met such people in person
29/12/2020, 21:53 - Wh: They never account for competitiveness in modern economy ah?
29/12/2020, 21:53 - Wh: No wonder all male die earlier than females
29/12/2020, 21:54 - Wh: They are more stress
29/12/2020, 21:54 - Peiran: What the heck
29/12/2020, 21:54 - Wh: Exactly
29/12/2020, 21:54 - Peiran: That one is on the macro scale of the whole country
Not individuals
29/12/2020, 21:55 - Peiran: No such thing as your country has potential in economic growth so your people also like that
29/12/2020, 21:55 - Wh: Old archaic law that makes no sense in the modern world supported by a bunch of traditionalist/ conservatives/ nationalist that speaks some bullshit about supporting said law then every sheeple believe/reinforced the idea...
29/12/2020, 21:56 - Wh: I tell you singapore will soon lose its competitive edge if such law is not abolished/changed
29/12/2020, 21:56 - Peiran: Even like that it does not affect how they choose international students 
I don't like your country so I don't accept you
If the uni like that honestly it's not worth applying
29/12/2020, 21:57 - Wh: I am talking about NS though
29/12/2020, 21:57 - Peiran: Why does NS bother so much
All those been through NS still migrate what

29/12/2020, 21:58 - Wh: But need rush masters
29/12/2020, 21:58 - Wh: So more stress
29/12/2020, 21:58 - Wh: Which is bad for health
29/12/2020, 21:58 - Peiran: No need
Just follow your own pace
29/12/2020, 21:58 - Wh: All boils down to stupid NS
29/12/2020, 21:58 - Wh: This is the key
29/12/2020, 21:59 - Tan Xin Kai: What's happening here
29/12/2020, 21:59 - Peiran: Waste time?
That depends on how you utilize your time
29/12/2020, 21:59 - Peiran: <Media omitted>
29/12/2020, 21:59 - Wh: No it doesn't
29/12/2020, 21:59 - Wh: You can't even do uni in NS

29/12/2020, 21:59 - Wh: Old archaic law that makes no sense in the modern world supported by a bunch of traditionalist/ conservatives/ nationalist that speaks some bullshit about supporting said law then every sheeple believe/reinforced the idea...
29/12/2020, 22:00 - Peiran: There is this thing called lifelong learning if you can recall your sec school English syllabus
29/12/2020, 22:00 - Peiran: You don't learn for your studies only
29/12/2020, 22:00 - Wh: All useless terms
29/12/2020, 22:00 - Peiran: You learn for your whole life
29/12/2020, 22:00 - Wh: Doesnt translate to me actually getting uni cert
29/12/2020, 22:01 - Peiran: That's why a lot of people when started working all becomes bored in life
29/12/2020, 22:01 - Wh: You don't need to learn if you learn them already
29/12/2020, 22:01 - Wh: It's called retirement
29/12/2020, 22:02 - Peiran: There are a lot of things that uni don't teach
29/12/2020, 22:02 - Peiran: And you can develop your own hobbies
29/12/2020, 22:02 - Wh: I rather get my uni cert first then  do anything else
29/12/2020, 22:02 - Peiran: You don't know your potential unless you tried it
29/12/2020, 22:02 - Wh: It's so important especially for migrating
29/12/2020, 22:02 - Wh: You need to migrate when you are young period

29/12/2020, 22:04 - Peiran: Not oppressing your determination to migrate
But just gentle reminders and advice on that
29/12/2020, 22:04 - Wh: I rather fo North america

Singapore provides none of these
29/12/2020, 22:06 - Peiran: And yes I know you are very utilitarian and pragmatic

29/12/2020, 22:08 - Tan Xin Kai: Wow
29/12/2020, 22:08 - Peiran: Solutions:
1. Most office works hot aircon
2. SG is highly open to other economies, you have a lot of chances to interact with people with different backgrounds (say China guys like me)
3. Stress is based on your own mindset also
4. Define personal freedom
29/12/2020, 22:08 - Tan Xin Kai: Totally ignoring me

29/12/2020, 22:10 - Tan Xin Kai: Hmm he wants to do it freestyle

29/12/2020, 22:13 - Peiran: Let me summarise for you:
29/12/2020, 22:13 - Tan Xin Kai: <Media omitted>
29/12/2020, 22:15 - Peiran: 1. He is worried about age as a key factor that obstructs his path to migrate because some countries need young age and working experience 
2. Regarding point 1, he claimed that NS is a waste if time because that doesn't contribute to his undergraduate studies
3. With point 2 being said, he claimed need to rush through his studies to reduce the impact of that age gap
29/12/2020, 22:17 - Tan Xin Kai: Huh
29/12/2020, 22:17 - Tan Xin Kai: Study only how many years
29/12/2020, 22:18 - Peiran: You don't think NS is waste of time right 
You just hate NS, that doesn't mean you should waste your time to express your hate

30/12/2020, 20:44 - Wh: You do know the ferry timing. I advise you to take the earliest ferry in order to reach BMTC at around 8am.
30/12/2020, 20:44 - Wh: So you can hoto from the previous day duty clerk
30/12/2020, 20:45 - Wh: If you late, it is also not your fault cause the ferry timing screwed up
30/12/2020, 20:56 - Tan Xin Kai: If I late the SDO encik will hammer me
30/12/2020, 20:56 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol

30/12/2020, 21:10 - Tan Xin Kai: Lolll
30/12/2020, 21:10 - Tan Xin Kai: Something wh won't know how it feels
30/12/2020, 21:10 - Peiran: By right if you stay in they need to indent food for you
So they usually don't allow you to stay in is because they got no time to indent food
30/12/2020, 21:10 - Peiran: What the heck
30/12/2020, 21:11 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea lah... By right
30/12/2020, 21:11 - Peiran: If you are in my unit you will sign 1 extra for every 5 minutes you are late
30/12/2020, 21:11 - Tan Xin Kai: Yes it's true that if legit the next duty clerk didnt come yet u are obliged to stay till u hoto
30/12/2020, 21:11 - Tan Xin Kai: Hmm Wen Han is lucky enough... That time he said his first duty clerk he was late for 2h
30/12/2020, 21:11 - Peiran: This is called lack if responsibility 
This kind of people in TV shows don't survive past the 3rd episode

03/01/2021, 21:32 - Wh: <Media omitted>
03/01/2021, 22:43 - Wh: White people are beasts and attack dogs. In the most literal sense. It is almost as if their version of the bible which has permeated white culture makes them insane beasts in sheep's clothing. For what reason does a person want  to watch or do wwe wrestling, televangelist preaching, skiing, wingsuit gliding, climb up buildings, climb up mountains with no rope, chase tornados. It is crazy making. It is a group of mentally insane people that had moved into the race. Most non-white people's lineage who transitioned into the white race were insane people. Look at the type of people associating with white people. It is literally are insane and weak people. Diversity of race and opinion is a good thing for the world.
03/01/2021, 23:01 - Peiran: What the heck
03/01/2021, 23:07 - Tan Xin Kai: Ikr wth, Wen Han the heck is this

03/01/2021, 23:11 - Wh: But luckily I got connections

03/01/2021, 23:15 - Peiran: Basically if you can move yourself they will hire you

03/01/2021, 23:15 - Peiran: Plus their medical caregivers are going on strike
03/01/2021, 23:15 - Peiran: And are they opting in to do that
03/01/2021, 23:17 - Peiran: Army medics did swab tests for domestic workers without asking a single cent
Why can outside people do the same thing to much fewer people and ask for 3k
03/01/2021, 23:17 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol
03/01/2021, 23:17 - Tan Xin Kai: They need the power of money
03/01/2021, 23:18 - Tan Xin Kai: Army medics are like free flow labout
03/01/2021, 23:18 - Tan Xin Kai: Labour
03/01/2021, 23:18 - Peiran: And the more lack of people the more labour you need to do
03/01/2021, 23:18 - Peiran: And that is usually not proportionate
03/01/2021, 23:18 - Tan Xin Kai: True
03/01/2021, 23:18 - Peiran: Eg. Now they looking for people to do swab test but pay you 6k
Like that you probably do 20x work than now
03/01/2021, 23:19 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
03/01/2021, 23:20 - Peiran: Pay you that much to do simple stuff? You misunderstand the word 'simple'
03/01/2021, 23:20 - Wh: It's called risk pay
03/01/2021, 23:20 - Peiran: That pay is not worth the risk
03/01/2021, 23:21 - Peiran: At least for people without formal training
03/01/2021, 23:22 - Peiran: There are many people want to do this work and you already lost on the first level to most candidates 
Which is nursing and caregiving training
And most of them got certs
03/01/2021, 23:22 - Tan Xin Kai: True
03/01/2021, 23:22 - Tan Xin Kai: And is it worth the risk and exposure
03/01/2021, 23:22 - Tan Xin Kai: Just for the money
03/01/2021, 23:23 - Peiran: True they want manpower 
But they prefer trained manpower 
3 trained nurses is better than 50 untrained people
03/01/2021, 23:24 - Peiran: Esp on medical terms 
Because they will totally disallow errors and ennui to happen
03/01/2021, 23:24 - Wh: Lol
03/01/2021, 23:24 - Tan Xin Kai: Ok I'll see u applying for such jobs
03/01/2021, 23:25 - Wh: At least u are more protected than let's say this
03/01/2021, 23:25 - Wh: See me? I am just recommending, if you don't want then it's not up to me
03/01/2021, 23:25 - Tan Xin Kai: I was just asking abt being a Digital Ambassador

03/01/2021, 23:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Cus I'm planning for ord lol
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Wh: You are more exposed being this to the virus
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Peiran: This is the sign of a recession or burst of economic bubble
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Wh: Cause xk has nothing better to do
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Haha
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Isn't recession
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Peiran: Just look at Japan in the 80s
03/01/2021, 23:26 - Tan Xin Kai: It's*
03/01/2021, 23:27 - Peiran: Especially doing part time at a young age and with low education level
03/01/2021, 23:27 - Tan Xin Kai: That means underemployment
03/01/2021, 23:27 - Tan Xin Kai: If it's a long term thing
03/01/2021, 23:27 - Wh: It's even worse when you take in the fact that Japan's population is declining. I just saw a mini documentary on youtube the other day and they showed how numerous newly built apartment buildings in Japan were empty, because there are no people to occupy it. Entire schools are also closing down because there are no children.

By 2100, It's estimated that Japan's population will be decreased by HALF, and over 35% will be over the age of 65.  There won't be enough of a working population to support the economy. 
This means that Japan will have no choice to relax their immigration policy and open up their border for more foreigners to settle in. When this happens, Japanese culture and Japanese people will disappear. 



Globalist capitalism is ultimately a scary thing when you take a peek into the future. Or perhaps it's inevitable and is just the normal progression of civilization....

Unfortunately there is no one to blame but the Japanese themselves. Japanese general public is usually indifferent to politics. Japan also cannot keep up in this techonlogical era and they are stagnating when it comes to innovation. They are an export economy, meaning they must innovate forever or they will die. 

The Japanese government is also overly bureacratic and weak, letting themselves easily taken advantage by neoliberals. Furthermore, the Japanese government in recent times has been acting irrationally under Shinzo Abe (and now Yoshihide Suga). They constantly antagonize their Asian neighbors China, South Korea, and Taiwan, while clinging harder to the U.S.

If we also want to talk about why they came into this situation in this first place, it was after WW2 when the Americans made sure that Japan‚Äôs economy was dependent and tied in with the West. Americans also dictated their foreign and defence policy, and even wrote their constitution. More importantly, western thought and western culture has penetrated deep into Japanese minds..... If Imperial Japan never started a war against their Asian neighbors in WW2, they wouldn't even be in this situation in the first place. Their unnecessary actions led the US to take control of them, which is ironic because that was the very thing they wanted to avoid in the first place. It is the price they are paying for waging war.

Japan is also to blame for the situation in Korea. Their colonization and occupation of Korea brought the country to ruins, creating a power vacuum in the peninsula which left it wide open for vultures like the US and the USSR to quickly swoop in. This caused the Korean War and its eventual split into the North and the South. If Japan had left Korea alone, Korea would be standing today as a unified country free from all foreign influence. But right now, it seems like South Korea is headed towards the same path as Japan.

Japan's actions led the US to extend its military, economic, and cultural influence deep into Asia.

03/01/2021, 23:29 - Wh: It's most of Asia, not just Japan.

Many non Asians who move to Asia, especially China, Japan and Korea are extremely racist.

A lot of white supremacists have already moved or want to move to Japan or Korea for what they call 'racial purity,' meaning 'no blacks' in these countries and therefore they can get away from blacks/browns by moving to Japan or Korea.

A lot of blacks have moved or want to move to Asia, especially Japan or Korea to escape anti-black racism in the US or in other countries.

In Asia, especially in countries like Japan or Korea, locals and cops don't shoot blacks from behind or choke them to death or put knees on their necks till death or lynch them or harass them for just being black. Nothing like that ever happens.

So these people (especially, black Americans) who move to Asia should be extremely grateful to these Asian countries for letting them into their countries and allowing them to live  a good life in peace, which is not even possible in their own home countries!

But instead, these expats are extremely racist toward other races, especially toward the locals.

If you look at Asian country subs in reddit or any other expat forum or chat places in social media, they're always shitting on their host countries and locals basically just for being 'Asian.'

And they just LOVE calling Asians the most racist for nonsensical reasons like just looking at them or not looking at them or sitting too close to them or not sitting right next to them or speaking English to them instead of the local language or not speaking English at all, blah, blah, blah.

Instead of being grateful to these Asian countries for letting them in and giving them jobs and safety, these people laugh at Asians for letting them in and giving them jobs and safety.

Also, they think they're so superior and above Asians and their governments that they often don't even follow the local rules/laws, starting from not wearing masks to breaking English teaching contracts and leaving the country at any time without telling the employers and  not paying taxes.

r/ korea and r/ teachinginkorea are full of posts and comments like that every day, expats telling other expats or those planning to move to Korea how to break rules and not pay taxes in Korea while living and working in Korea, taking advantage of all the benefits.

Reading their posts and comments really piss me off, and I'm sure most locals would feel angry too if they find out. Angry enough to think their local cops should be more like American cops toward these criminal expats.

03/01/2021, 23:33 - Wh: Yes, you are right that Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) deserves attention and scrutiny for his political legacy regardless of whether you agree with all his policies and ideologies. Especially with regard to the "Singapore Model" and its influence on China:

&amp;#x200B;

"This special section deals with China's longstanding fascination with Singapore's development experience that has preoccupied post-Maoist leaders from Deng Xiaoping to Xi Jinping despite the obvious differences between the tiny Southeast Asian city-state and the most populous country on earth. **In particular, there is great Chinese interest in Singapore's success in combining effective governance and efficient state capitalism with stable one-party dominant rule.** As a consequence, Chinese observers paid much less attention to electoral democracies that were well-governed states with mature economies."

Source: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/introduction-the-singapore-model-and-chinas-neoauthoritarian-dream/2ED7A22E42E1D9E2CA3A116047C8D58D/core-reader](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/introduction-the-singapore-model-and-chinas-neoauthoritarian-dream/2ED7A22E42E1D9E2CA3A116047C8D58D/core-reader)

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, however, LKY was ultimately a pragmatist in regard to the West. For America's (often overlooked) role in the Singapore Story during the Cold War era, see:

"At the height of the Cold War in Southeast Asia,¬†the foreign relations between the United States and Singapore demonstrated the interplay between America‚Äôs strategy of containment and Singapore‚Äôs efforts at a non-aligned foreign policy. But there is a deeper story. American involvement in the Vietnam War not only held back the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, but also catalysed economic and strategic cooperation between the United States and Singapore. The author argues that Singapore might not have achieved its success so rapidly without the support of the US.

As the war in Vietnam raged on, Singapore became a critical refueling point, also providing ship and aircraft repair for the US military. Commercial and strategic support from the United States lifted Singapore out of the economic doom predicted for the city-state after secession from Malaysia, cessation of Indonesian trade during *Konfrontasi*¬†and Britain‚Äôs military withdrawal. By considering the importance of the US‚Äôs role in Singapore‚Äôs nation-building, this book provides an important supplement to the well-trodden narrative that attributes Singapore‚Äôs success to good governance."

For white supremacists, tell them their idol Adolf Hilter praised Asians. [https://qr.ae/pNVI0K](https://qr.ae/pNVI0K)

 "Pride in one's own race - and that does not imply contempt for other races - is also a normal and healthy sentiment. I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilizations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them" 

Can anyone edit wikipedia? that quote used to be in wikipedia but it's gone from the entry on Adolf Hilter. Putting it back would put Asians on pedestal. I encourage putting Asian Male on the pedestal.
04/01/2021, 06:56 - Wh: There is nothing prestigious about having a white SO and Eurasian kids

Ignoring how having a white spouse and Eurasian kids are seen as "desirable" as a result of white supremacy/internalised racism, there is nothing prestigious about this this day and age. This has to do with how it's now possible to *buy* a white SO. Yes, an AM can't get a WW to date him by lowering his standards and putting all WW on a pedestal (unlike their female counterparts), but it's certainly possible for AM to buy a WW mail-order bride and subsequently have Eurasian kids. There is nothing prestigious about buying a wife. While mail-order grooms aren't really a thing, it's certainly possible for an AW to "buy" a white husband by meeting unemployed WM in the West via online dating sites and offering to pay for all of their expenses after getting married. I'm pretty sure there are poor WM out there who don't mind leaching off wealthy AW. It's also possible for AW to sign up to be mail-order brides themselves. Again, I don't know how anyone can see this as "prestigious".

The same applies to Eurasian kids. Even if self-hating Asians marry other Asians, it is certainly possible to "buy" Eurasian kids. All you need to do is buy sperm or eggs from a white donor. This is something which can done with money. For AW, they can have Eurasian kids just by hooking up with WM they've met via Tinder and insisting the men don't use condoms.

I've seen self-hating Asians say how snagging a white  (sometimes hapa) SO in Asia is prestigious similar to snagging an ultra rich Asian SO as both are "difficult". I don't think the two can even be compared to each other. It's possible for "buy" a white spouse unlike an ultra rich Asian. You can also snag a WM SO by lowering your standards whereas this is not possible for someone super rich.

06/01/2021, 05:58 - Wh: It doesn't make sense when whites say Asian countries are more xenophobic than western ones

A lot of whites like to talk about Asian countries being xenophobic because it is less racially diverse than the West. Honestly, I have no idea why they say that. One of the reasons why the West is so racially diverse is because POCs want to move there. Meanwhile, not that many non-Asians want to live in Asia.

And honestly, it's way easier for a westerner to find a job in a non-western country than the other way around which just goes to show Asia is more xenophilic than the West. It's generally very hard for a person in Asia to secure a job in the West prior to moving there. Meanwhile, this is different for westerners and even moving to another western country isn't hard for them. They can easily find a job teaching ESL, being an au pair, or ask their companies to transfer them to a branch in another country. Jobs in non-western countries such as piloting are also known to recruit foreign westerners. Just look at the sub r/IWantOut and you can see the difference. While some Asians in Asia do succeed in securing jobs in other countries, this is not an option for most people. Pretty much all of the Asians I know who have moved to the West don't have a job lined up beforehand and many of them end up in minimum wage jobs.

02/04/2021, 19:03 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol
02/04/2021, 19:03 - Peiran: They won't prioritize your own stuff
Rather than their work
02/04/2021, 19:03 - Wh: I am concern for you
02/04/2021, 19:03 - Tan Xin Kai: Very true

03/04/2021, 14:16 - Tan Xin Kai: Cus it's not feasible at the rate HR does things and just plainly ignore all my slots requests

03/04/2021, 14:24 - Tan Xin Kai: Yes it's better idea to do it with BZ instead with my schedule. Not always things will go the same way as u think and it's natural to have to make changes
03/04/2021, 14:25 - Tan Xin Kai: I don't know how to say already. Wen Han, you really gotta know not everyone needs to follow the exact same way and life is such.
03/04/2021, 14:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Not saying that I don't wanna do with u but my schedule and their HR is such that it's better to do another date
03/04/2021, 14:26 - Wh: ^
03/04/2021, 14:27 - Wh: The way you reject me is wrong
03/04/2021, 14:28 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea of course I have to always agree and spare no ways at rejecting anything at all
03/04/2021, 14:29 - Tan Xin Kai: And of course it's right to just order one to change schedule when it's not really convenient to do so
03/04/2021, 14:37 - Wh: So of course you rejected my proposition
03/04/2021, 14:38 - Wh: Be of course your sarcasm
03/04/2021, 14:38 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea cus someone can't handle rejections
03/04/2021, 14:38 - Tan Xin Kai: Also isn't Bo Zheng our friend
03/04/2021, 14:40 - Wh: You of course don't know how to phrase it

26/05/2021, 09:55 - Wh: In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the¬†Xinjiang papers, the¬†2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests,¬†China's Wolf warrior diplomacy, and the¬†Uyghur genocide, calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Games.¬†In a July 30, 2020 letter, the¬†World Uyghur Congress¬†urged the IOC to reconsider holding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of the Uyghur genocide.¬†In September 2020,¬†United States Senator¬†Rick Scott¬†spoke with IOC Vice President Anita DeFrantz about reconsidering the IOC's decision to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in China. Scott expressed disappointment that the IOC refused to commit to move the games out of China.¬†In October 2020, British Foreign Secretary¬†Dominic Raab¬†suggested the¬†United Kingdom¬†may boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics.
China's use of trade sanctions and economic¬†coercion¬†against¬†Australia¬†has led to increased calls within Australia to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics.¬†In November 2020, Australian Senators¬†Jacqui Lambie¬†and¬†Rex Patrick¬†officially proposed a boycott. Their proposal was later voted down.¬†Some human rights organizations have called for a diplomatic boycott that would mean countries not sending their¬†heads of state¬†or high-ranking officials to the Olympics but still sending athletes.¬†13 Canadian¬†Members of Parliament¬†signed a letter calling for the games to be moved outside of China. Three party leaders have supported relocation of the games, and one leader even stated that she supported the games to be moved to Canada.¬†In February 2021 six more Republican U.S. Senators called for the Games to be moved.¬†Dutch MP¬†Sjoerd Sjoerdsma¬†said the Olympics should also be stripped from China citing the¬†Uyghur genocide.¬†In March 2021 American alpine skier¬†Mikaela Shiffrin¬†said that she should not have to choose between her morals and her job due to the human rights issues raised over the games.¬†In April 2021, the¬†U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom¬†recommended that U.S. government officials boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics "if the Chinese government's crackdown on religious freedom continues."¬†After the report, Senators¬†Mitt Romney¬†and¬†Tim Kaine¬†added an amendment to a larger China bill calling for a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Olympics, where U.S. officials would not attend but U.S. athletes could still compete.
In February 2021, the Chinese state-run outlet¬†Global Times¬†warned that China would "seriously sanction any country that follows a boycott."¬†And in March 2021 Chinese spokesperson Guo Weimin stated that any attempt to boycott the Olympics would be doomed to fail.¬†Chinese Foreign Minister¬†Wang Yi¬†also told EU‚Äôs foreign policy chief¬†Josep Borrell¬†that they should attend the games to "enhance exchanges on winter sport," and to ‚Äúfoster new highlights‚Äù in bilateral cooperation.
The IOC has stated that it remains neutral in all global political issues and that the award of hosting the games does not mean that the IOC agrees with the political structure, social circumstances or human rights standards in the country it is held in. "We've repeatedly said it: the IOC isn't responsible for the government. It only gives the rights and opportunity for the staging of the Olympic Games. That doesn't mean we agree with all the politics, all the social or human rights issues in the country. And it doesn't mean we approve of all the human rights violations of a person or people," the committee's response to AFP read. The position has generated criticism with¬†Jules Boykoff¬†accusing the IOC of hypocrisy by saying that it ignores its charter that promotes equality and anti-discrimination when it's convenient to do so and that the IOC "has shown an "unfortunate propensity for turning away from human rights atrocities in order to make sure that the games go on.
In a nationwide survey conducted in March 2021, 54% of Canadians said the country should boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, while 24% believed it should not and 21% were not sure.

Dear Scholar,
¬†
We note that you have accepted the scholarship offer online, and we understand that some of you are currently overseas, and may be making travel arrangements to Singapore.
¬†
As a recipient of the¬†Science & Technology Undergraduate Merit Scholarship, the scholarship will waive off the Covid-19 swab test fees and Stay-home-notice (SHN) accommodation in the form of a subsidy, as long as the SHN and swab test are requirements for entry to Singapore and subject to meeting the relevant waiver requirements. The subsidy provided is one-off per scholar.¬†Please note that¬†this additional subsidy will be considered as part of the total scholarship monies paid to you, and will be repayable in the event of a default on the terms and conditions of the scholarship.¬† ¬†
¬†
Please note that as part of your scholarship benefits,¬†you are entitled for the reimbursement of a one‚Äêway air ticket from your home country to Singapore. You will not be reimbursed for any other costs of travel to the airport, e.g., taxi or train. Details on how to submit your claims will be provided to you at a later date after you matriculate into NUS. In the meantime, scholars should retain all relevant receipts and documentations, in order to facilitate the submissions of your claims later on.
¬†
Important Travel Information
Scholars should only proceed with their trip to Singapore, upon completion of the necessary formalities, including the following:
a)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Obtaining the Student‚Äôs Pass or Student‚Äôs Pass In-principle Approval from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA)
b)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Obtaining the entry approval from the Safe Travel Office (under the¬†Immigration & Checkpoint Authority), which is¬†valid for one week once issued.¬†Students should not proceed with their trip to Singapore, unless they have received the entry approval letter.
¬†
Based on¬†ICA‚Äôs latest travel policy as of 17 May 2021, depending on where you have been in the last consecutive 21 days prior to your arrival in Singapore, you may be issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for up to 21 days upon arrival into Singapore, as well as undergo Covid-19 test. Additionally, students may be placed on an additional 7-days leave-of-absence by NUS, upon completion of their SHN issued by the ICA if their SHN duration is less than 21 days.
¬†
Taking into consideration the above, we would like to advise scholars to plan your travel early, in order to arrive in Singapore in time for classes for the Academic Year 2021/2022.
¬†
As the situation is continuing to evolve, please refer to the¬†NUS Registrar‚Äôs Office webpage, which provides important information on the various travel advisories for entry into Singapore, so that you can make any travel decisions in an informed and considered manner.
¬†
Lastly, further instructions pertaining to your scholarship, which will be sent to you soon.¬†We seek your patience and understanding on this.

30/05/2021, 12:08 - Peiran: Whatever dish just type the name in Katakana and it becomes Japanese

But never say they will offer you a job
So it's you who go to find your own job
30/05/2021, 12:13 - Tan Xin Kai: True
30/05/2021, 12:13 - Peiran: And if you never find a job say all places turn you down then you have broken the contract
30/05/2021, 12:13 - Tan Xin Kai: Just like the tuition grant for PR
30/05/2021, 12:13 - Tan Xin Kai: True
30/05/2021, 12:14 - Peiran: Just remember this
If the college can offer you a scholarship itself must earn back the values from you eventually

30/05/2021, 12:17 - Tan Xin Kai: For all arrivals

30/05/2021, 12:19 - Tan Xin Kai: Test faster better than delayed results
30/05/2021, 12:19 - Tan Xin Kai: And delay vaccination
30/05/2021, 12:19 - Tan Xin Kai: To ensure sufficient Stocks
30/05/2021, 12:20 - Peiran: But how can they test faster though
30/05/2021, 12:21 - Tan Xin Kai: Quick test with ART, antigen rapid test
30/05/2021, 12:21 - Tan Xin Kai: Which uses diff method... Aka using trace detection of VOOCs chemicals that are in your breathe and use AI to detect
30/05/2021, 12:21 - Tan Xin Kai: Compared to PCR which needs to be sent to lab and takes hours
30/05/2021, 12:22 - Peiran: But before that they need to test out its reliability first
30/05/2021, 12:23 - Peiran: Takes months to pilot test and analyse the results
30/05/2021, 12:23 - Peiran: While meantime they still need to send people to quarantine 
Most people kena during that part
30/05/2021, 12:26 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea that's why they testing it at Tuas haha

30/05/2021, 12:27 - Tan Xin Kai: For low risks countries only
30/05/2021, 12:27 - Peiran: Meaning they want a mass cluster on the plane
30/05/2021, 12:28 - Peiran: Yet all those countries have the policy that if you need to travel overseas you must take the test
30/05/2021, 12:28 - Peiran: And must be vaccinated
30/05/2021, 12:29 - Tan Xin Kai: True
30/05/2021, 12:36 - Tan Xin Kai: But sg choose to give them freedom

30/05/2021, 13:19 - Wh: It's the best game I have ever played
30/05/2021, 13:20 - Wh: It's like far cry
30/05/2021, 13:21 - Wh: Man this game is getting A LOT of hate. Personally, I love it. I've been grinding away. I love the new drone enemies and the futuristic architecture. The world feels much bigger than in Wildlands and I think not being able to request a helicopter all the time is a big contributor to that. I'm not a fan of the player hub in the game though. Seeing a bunch of Ghosts running around is somewhat immersion breaking, but you can avoid going there for the most part unless you have an objective there.

Le monde semble beaucoup plus grand qu'√† Wildlands et je pense que le fait de ne pas pouvoir demander un h√©licopt√®re tout le temps y contribue grandement.  Je ne suis pas fan du hub de joueurs dans le jeu.  Voir un tas de fant√¥mes courir est un peu une rupture d'immersion, mais vous pouvez √©viter d'y aller pour la plupart √† moins d'avoir un objectif l√†-bas.

30/05/2021, 15:00 - Wh: We understand that some families need to move in bigger groups of more than 2 persons, especially those with young children or elderly parents, and we are prepared to provide flexibility for these families. Family members staying together, meaning sharing the same residential address, can go out in groups larger than 2 persons.
This may include taking public transport, going for medical appointments, attending classes, grocery shopping or going to work in the same vehicle. However, please do try to minimise the number of such large group outings and also try to keep to 2 persons as much as possible to minimise your family‚Äôs potential exposure to the virus.
Please help us to uphold a public discipline that keeps Singapore safe.
