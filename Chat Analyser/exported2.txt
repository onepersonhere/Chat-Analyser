27/03/2020, 17:53 - Wh: The Netherlands is also referred to as Holland in various languages, including English. The region of Holland proper consists of North and South Holland, two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province, and earlier still, the County of Holland, a remnant of the dissolved Frisian Kingdom. Following the decline of the Duchy of Brabant and the County of Flanders, Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the Low Countries region.
27/03/2020, 17:54 - Wh: Province*
27/03/2020, 17:54 - Wh: The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the Dutch Republic, the Eighty Years' War, and the Anglo-Dutch Wars in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a pars pro toto for the entire country, which is now considered informal or incorrect. The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.
27/03/2020, 17:54 - Tan Xin Kai: So is it something like UK
27/03/2020, 17:54 - Tan Xin Kai: With its kingdom

27/03/2020, 17:55 - Wh: But they are considered as province*

02/04/2020, 16:21 - Wh: Like this I also cannot go nights out if I stay in
02/04/2020, 16:21 - Tan Xin Kai: Dear all, I have decided to impose the following rules for all BMTC comds/trainers/perm staff: 

1. For all stay out personnel:
a. To go home straight after work. 
b. Stay home and minimise social interactions as much as possible. 
c. Minimise travel outside of home except for essential reasons.

2. For stay-in personnel:
a. Para 1a, 1b and 1c applies. 
b. All nights off will be banned.

On top of this, all perm staff are required to stay within their Functional Groups (FG) at Br and Company level except for work purposes (e.g. coy COSes performing cookhouse duty) while in BMTC. No cross FG mingling at places such as the canteen etc.

All deviation must be approved by minimally Sch 2ICs/Br Heads.

These measures are meant to keep the virus out of the island. 
 
Outside of work, the key question all our perm staff must now ask is not "can i do this?" But "is it necessary/essential for me to do this? If not, don't "

For info, there are HHQ considerations to impose even stricter measures on bmtc. What i am trying to do is to 
proactively place certain measures in order to minimise pain and lessen morale issues. I need all comds to carry the ground and communicate to our perm staff. I will follow with an email to all KAHs/OCs/CCTs by noon time. For the time being, pls start your own comms.

06/04/2020, 22:00 - Tan Xin Kai: *FAQs for BMTC on the Suspension of BMT*

*Q1. Can I continue to train for my IPPT during the suspension period?*

A1. There will be a set of fitness regime guide uploaded to your LEARNet portal which you can refer to and exercise from home. If you need to exercise outdoors in a park, keep a safe distance from others during your workout.

*Q2. Will the suspension affect my chances of getting into command schools such as OCS/SCS?*

A2. No, it will not affect your chances into command schools. Your Officers and Sergeants will continue to monitor your BMT performance and progress after the resumption of training at BMTC.

*Q3. How do I get updates for subsequent resumption of training/BMT?*

A3. Your BMTC commanders will update you as soon as there is any information in the resumption of training.

*Q4. Will there be a delay to my BMT Graduation Parade?*

A4. We are still working on the progressive training programme upon resumption of BMT training and will update if there is any impact on your graduation date. 

*Q5. How will the home-based learning be carried out?*

A5. You will continue to have access to the SAF's LEARNet modules. The course curriculum includes theory lessons and quizzes on basic soldiering skills on topics like technical handling and fieldcraft, as well as a set of fitness regime guide for you to follow from home. There are also discussion forums on the LEARNet portal for your commanders to engage you and to answer any of your queries.

*Q6. I am a perm-staff in BMTC. Where will I report to during the suspension of training at BMTC?*

A6. For trainers and perm staff of BMTC, those who are involved in administrative work should telecommute if possible. There are some work that cannot be done from home. For these personnel who need to continue to report to camp, the implemented safe distancing measures must be adhered to. Please approach your commanders for further instructions.

22/04/2020, 08:13 - Tan Xin Kai: Was talking about this yesterday
22/04/2020, 09:18 - Wh: Many billionaires wouldn't give 2 thoughts about violating safe distance measures...

They have their own pool, tennis court, golf course, planes & helicopters, cars and chauffeurs, own chefs for their meals and of course a luxurious house with multiple yachts that are bigger than their house... 

Point being... only the common people will suffer the effect of this emergency law, they need to pay extra money (fine) and has a high liklihood of contracting the disease while doing their shopping/going places, which means they face a diminishing market for ventilators, disposable mask and hospital beds.... meanwhile the rich can afford their own ventilators and doctors if they contracted the virus...:(

And who allowed this to happen? Capitalism and the government and the society... 

Of course the society is to be blamed because we accept wages that are lower than the amount of profit we generated for the company we are working for, and for the top guy in the corporate ladder to reap all our hard work for their own gains. We allowed it to happen. We are exploited and we shall fight back!  Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!

22/04/2020, 16:19 - Wh: Disintegrating pipes, insulation, walls, tiles, vinyl flooring, stovetop pads, and other older materials that have been present in the building since its construction are signs to look out for.

Look for cracks, dusty areas and spots where the material seems to be in the process of breaking down and falling apart.
22/04/2020, 16:20 - Tan Xin Kai: Like the right to life.... The interpretation is general... But exceptions to imprisonment, those under ISA

22/04/2020, 16:20 - Tan Xin Kai: If it's another country like US, ISA would mean it contravenes the constitution, which is supposed to be the supreme law, and hence be struck down as unconstitutional

04/05/2020, 05:37 - Wh: Boo
04/05/2020, 06:33 - Wh: Since the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties. These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them. For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the People's Action Party of Singapore (PAP) maintains its total domination over Singaporean politics through its "low-key presence, but total control." According to the CPC's own analysis of Singapore, the PAP's dominance can be explained by its "well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups." While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a liberal democracy, they view it as a guided democracy led by the PAP. Other differences are, according to the CPC, "that it is not a political party based on the working class—instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the parliamentary system, not a revolutionary party." Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the United Malays National Organisation, which has ruled Malaysia (1957-2018), and the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, which dominated Japanese politics since 1955.

15/05/2020, 19:37 - Wh: So did you installed it?
15/05/2020, 21:02 - Wh: Hello?
15/05/2020, 21:23 - Wh: I guess any advice would really depend on what major you're in! For most students doing a single degree, they'll usually spend most of the time in their faculty buildings and maybe sometimes Utown so you can choose your food places and study spots based on that (I'm a year 3 student and I've never stepped into SDE or Biz buildings before). That said, some recommendations for food that I can vouch for are:

- The new Japanese Udon place at Utown (the one near the bus stop)

- Li Ji at Utown (HK style Cafe)

- Ayam Penyet at science/engin (I think it's called indonexpress or something like that - its the same owner so the food is exactly the same, there used to be one at foodclique at utown but it's no longer there)

- Mala at Fine Food/ Food Clique at utown (though personally the clem mala is better)

- Science Pasta store (the one at the non-air conditioned canteen)

- YONG TAU FU at DECK (the FASS Canteen)!!! 

- The Chicken rice store at deck is pretty decent as well.

The Engin/SDE canteen (called Techno) was closed for renovations for the last 2 years, and it had some really nice things. It should be opening again, albeit with a slightly different roster.

For study spaces, I like the ichiran-style desks that you can find at the ERC in utown, but they're usually occupied. The tables in the library are great too if you can find a spot. If you have friends from RCs and halls, they might be kind enough to let you use some of their shared spaces like dining halls or study areas and these are pretty good since there's usually less competition for space.

For navigation around school, just know the Internal shuttle buses that you need to take to get to your faculty and other common areas. There are actually only a few stops so it's not difficult at all to note down which ones you need. Navigation around your faculty is a bit more difficult depending on which faculty you're in. Engin and FASS were both built on hills (apparently to deter student protests in the 1970s), which has the unfortunate side-effect of making these faculties very hard to move around (Have you ever gone from level 1 to level 6 while walking in a straight path? You will if you're in Engineering). But you'll get used to it eventually.

Another thing I'd like to add is that you should really try to familiarize yourself with your course/faculty requirements and plan out your modules in advance! This will obviously depend on which course you're in, but you should try to learn how modules in NUS work and which modules you'll need to have completed by the end of 4 years. Based on that, you should then also be able to craft a 4 year timeline of what modules you'll be taking for which semester. You don't need to follow this plan to the tee, but it will help you with planning things like an exchange or an internship,  and also maintain a manageable workload throughout your time in uni.

16/05/2020, 22:43 - Tan Xin Kai: I knew it long ago... 3 religions originate from Jeruselam
16/05/2020, 22:44 - Tan Xin Kai: They are called Abrahamic Faiths
16/05/2020, 22:44 - Wh: Yes
16/05/2020, 22:44 - Wh: Quite coincidental isn't it?
16/05/2020, 22:44 - Wh: Btw Jesus and Muhammad is 500 years apart
16/05/2020, 22:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Have similar 'formats' of practices or norms like prayers from a book... No precise imagery of said god
16/05/2020, 22:45 - Tan Xin Kai: But according to my GP tutor last time... She's a Muslim and she said that Jesus is mentioned in the Quran too
16/05/2020, 22:46 - Wh: Hmm
16/05/2020, 22:46 - Wh: They said Jews and Christians believed Muhammad as a false prophet
16/05/2020, 22:46 - Tan Xin Kai: Maybe wild guess here is that they were split from the same archaic religion...
16/05/2020, 22:47 - Tan Xin Kai: Like different dominations but the differences became large enough to be split into different religions
16/05/2020, 22:47 - Wh: Hmm
16/05/2020, 22:47 - Wh: I have a feeling that muhammad is a jew
16/05/2020, 22:48 - Wh: Just like jesus
16/05/2020, 22:48 - Wh: Criticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century, when Muhammad was decried by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, and by the Jewish tribes of Arabia for his unwarranted appropriation of Biblical narratives and figures, vituperation of the Jewish faith, and proclaiming himself as "the last prophet" without performing any miracle nor showing any personal requirement demanded in the Hebrew Bible to distinguish a true prophet chosen by the God of Israel from a false claimant; for these reasons, they gave him the derogatory nickname ha-Meshuggah (Hebrew: מְשֻׁגָּע‬‎, "the Madman" or "the Possessed").
16/05/2020, 22:49 - Tan Xin Kai: U seemed into the history of these

16/05/2020, 22:50 - Tan Xin Kai: Also just realised that Malaysian Royalty naming tradition of the King is based on Last time Hinduism when they used to reign there
16/05/2020, 22:51 - Wh: Modern religious and secular criticism of Islam has concerned Muhammad's sincerity in claiming to be a prophet, his morality, his ownership of slaves, his treatment of enemies, his marriages, his treatment of doctrinal matters, and his psychological condition. Muhammad has been accused of sadism and mercilessness— including the invasion of the Banu Qurayza tribe in Medina—sexual relationships with slaves, and his marriage to Aisha when she was six years old, which according to most estimates was consummated when she was nine
16/05/2020, 22:51 - Wh: Lol hindusim
16/05/2020, 22:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Cos royalty is still somewhat superior in Malaysia... From commoners... Whereas if it's truly Islamic, all would be treated as equal including the royalty

19/05/2020, 15:57 - Wh: Circuit?
19/05/2020, 15:57 - Tan Xin Kai: Yea the inner circuit connections
19/05/2020, 15:58 - Tan Xin Kai: Cos it's the dimmer that's flickering
19/05/2020, 15:58 - Wh: you have a fluorescent light fixture that’s been around for more than 15 years, you might have a faulty starter. The starter is a small metallic cylinder that is attached to the light fixture. When the light switch is flipped on, the starter sends out a shot of electricity to the gas inside the fluorescent tube. That gas is then ionized and can conduct the electricity necessary to run the bulb. But there’s a slight delay in this process, so the bulbs flicker a bit before they turn on completely.
19/05/2020, 16:00 - Wh: So its either the bulb or lamp
19/05/2020, 16:00 - Wh: Btw don't break the fluorescent lamp it have mercury vapour
19/05/2020, 16:04 - Tan Xin Kai: Hmm it's not like those light on the ceiling ... It's instantaneous startup

19/05/2020, 16:04 - Tan Xin Kai: I suspect the circuit in the lamp
19/05/2020, 16:05 - Wh: You try disconnecting and connecting the bulb first

01/06/2020, 22:43 - Wh: Dear Commanders,

1.      The circuit breaker will end today (1 Jun) and Singapore will gradually resume activities over three phases. Addendum 12/20 to Ops Instruction 3-18(A) has been disseminated to you via OSN covering several updates to the measures taken by the Army against COVID-19.

*STAY HOME RESTRICTION ORDER (SHRO)* 🏡

2.      With the transition to Phase One (Safe Re-opening), SHRO will continue to apply to all servicemen. When not on duty or required at their workplace, servicemen under SHRO will be required to stay at home to prevent the importation and spread of COVID-19 within SAF camps. They are only allowed to leave their place of residence after seeking approval from their commanders for essential activities, with reference to WoG measures and permissible activities (e.g. buying food and groceries, getting a haircut, visiting parents/grandparents).

*MANAGEMENT OF SASH CASES* 👨🏻‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

3.      The health and safety of our service personnel are of utmost importance. The Swab-and-Send-Home (SASH) protocol is a precautionary measure in line with MOH's requirement, to test any serviceman who presents Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) symptoms for COVID-19 infection. *It does not mean that the serviceman is a suspect case* and there is *no need to create unnecesary concern* within the unit. The affected serviceman will be sent home on medical leave to rest and recover while the result of the swab test is pending. Details of the incident management and comms management for SASH cases can be found in the latest addendum.

*MANAGEMENT OF EQUIVOCAL CASES* 🧪🧫

4.      The addendum has also been updated to address the incident management for equivocal cases. *Equivocal cases* occur when swab test results are returned as *inconclusive results*. Servicemen will be scheduled for further testing and units would be required to execute precautionary measures, as stipulated in the addendum. Unit commanders should brief their servicemen about the equivocal cases and explain that the rationale of these measures as a precaution, in order to prevent speculation within the unit. Details of the incident management and comms management for equivocal cases can be found in the latest addendum.

*MASK-ON POLICY 😷*

5.      As our nation transits to Phase One (Safe Re-opening) of resuming activities safely, we will need to continue wearing masks during administrative activities and non-strenuous training. The mask-on policy will apply to all non-physical training (such as classroom lessons, weapon handling/ maintenance, simulator training etc.) and during pre- and post-training administration (such as conducting briefs, Action Learning Process, administrative movement to and from training area).

*SERVICEMEN REPORTING SICK OUTSIDE* 🏥👩🏻‍⚕️👨🏻‍⚕️

6.      With immediate effect, servicemen reporting sick outside for ARI symptoms are to inform the doctor that they are from the SAF. They will then be administered a swab test by the clinic, or be referred to a medical facility for one, as required by MOH. This is part of our SASH protocol which is administered as a precaution.

*REMINDER TO REPORT SICK IMMEDIATELY IF UNWELL*🤧🤒

7.      Over the past two weeks, there have been cases of servicemen only reporting sick after several days of displaying ARI symptoms and also cases of servicemen who reported back to camp even though they were already unwell. Commanders are to remind their servicemen of the importance to report sick immediately when unwell. Servicemen should report to the medical centre within their camp immediately if they are not feeling well. If they are out of camp, they should report sick outside if unwell instead of booking in. All servicemen must continue to play their part and be socially responsible to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

8.      Please refer to Addendum 12/20 to Ops Instruction 3-18(A) for more details. 

9.      We have also attached an infographic on *Our Army's Layered Defence against COVID-19* that summarises these measures and another infographic on *Our Army's Mask-On Policy*. You can forward these infographics to your servicemen for their reference.
 
*Together, we can overcome!* #SGunited

08/06/2020, 21:17 - Wh: Hmm I have a brilliant idea
08/06/2020, 21:18 - Wh: Why not create a matter synthesiser
08/06/2020, 21:19 - Wh: Something that can break down molecules into atoms, store the energy and create new molecules?
08/06/2020, 21:19 - Wh: Like this we can literally create food from thin air
08/06/2020, 21:20 - Wh: NO2 CO2 and H2O

08/06/2020, 21:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Wrong
08/06/2020, 21:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Energy is needed to break bonds
08/06/2020, 21:44 - Tan Xin Kai: Halal I'm not so sure... Vegetarian definitely not
08/06/2020, 21:45 - Tan Xin Kai: Do u even know whatcha talkin

08/06/2020, 21:49 - Tan Xin Kai: Isn't it
08/06/2020, 21:49 - Tan Xin Kai: Then why u say abt storing energy after breaking bonds
08/06/2020, 21:49 - Tan Xin Kai: I just dun get it
08/06/2020, 21:49 - Wh: Store energy from other places to break the bonds
08/06/2020, 21:49 - Tan Xin Kai: Cus multiple weird points of argument
08/06/2020, 21:50 - Tan Xin Kai: Like?
08/06/2020, 21:50 - Wh: Idk its a concept
08/06/2020, 21:50 - Tan Xin Kai: I can't visualise it
08/06/2020, 21:50 - Tan Xin Kai: Or is it a hypothesis only
08/06/2020, 21:50 - Wh: But ik tesla coil have sufficient energy to turn air into plasma
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Wh: So we can reorganised particles in the plasma to form perhaps proteins?
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Tan Xin Kai: U wanna turn stuff into burnt carbon?? Lol 🤔
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Wh: No need to visualise
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Wh: This is a concept
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Proteins u must know what it is
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Do u bio?
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Tan Xin Kai: It's the most complex thing u can make
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Wh: Perhaps*
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Tan Xin Kai: The longest molecule is a protein
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Wh: Its a what if scenario
08/06/2020, 21:51 - Tan Xin Kai: Called tintin
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Wh: Dk why you so into it
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Wh: Maybe cause you bio student
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Tan Xin Kai: And it's more dynamic
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Tan Xin Kai: Just telling u what I know
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Tan Xin Kai: Many dimensions
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Wh: Yes
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Tan Xin Kai: Simplest is amino acid
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Tan Xin Kai: Then many amino acid can join in many permutations
08/06/2020, 21:52 - Wh: We can reorganised C H N O particles into long chains of amino acids and proteins
08/06/2020, 21:53 - Wh: Possible?
08/06/2020, 21:53 - Wh: Energy deficit may occur but comeon food == energy
08/06/2020, 21:54 - Wh: So we can sell people synthetic food hahahaha
08/06/2020, 21:54 - Wh: Monopolise the market
08/06/2020, 21:55 - Tan Xin Kai: Then after forming the polypeptide chain, it can twist and turn and form any one bond between any 2 points
08/06/2020, 21:55 - Tan Xin Kai: And can have multiple different type of bonds at different places
08/06/2020, 21:55 - Tan Xin Kai: Literally permutations after permutations
08/06/2020, 21:55 - Wh: Yea ik
08/06/2020, 21:56 - Wh: But we also know the permutations
08/06/2020, 21:56 - Wh: So its easy for us to use a template to form the proteins we want
08/06/2020, 21:56 - Wh: Then mass production
08/06/2020, 21:57 - Wh: 1kg of 'meat' is $12
08/06/2020, 21:57 - Wh: We used $0? Material cost, $1 energy cost? $0.smth maintenance? Profit 10 $ per kg
08/06/2020, 22:04 - Tan Xin Kai: Hmm what if there's a bit of error that will change its properties
08/06/2020, 22:04 - Tan Xin Kai: And even edibility
08/06/2020, 22:04 - Tan Xin Kai: Is edibility a word
08/06/2020, 22:04 - Tan Xin Kai: What proteins y want
08/06/2020, 22:04 - Tan Xin Kai: Lol
08/06/2020, 22:05 - Tan Xin Kai: Rather than forming from scratch... Isn't it more economically viable to form proteins from amino acids
08/06/2020, 22:06 - Tan Xin Kai: Also regarding psychological aspect, how will you market the _food products_
09/06/2020, 07:05 - Wh: Its a concept

26/06/2020, 15:11 - Tan Xin Kai: H CCT :

NM Ehance breakfast indented 200 for out ration,  but scan as 2 and  these 2 are the one actually dine in. Which mean the 200 out ration was 0 
And VC indented 1 but was 0.

The meal cost is $4.70 x 198 pax = $930.60 for and 1 x $4.70 VC = $4.70. A  very big wastage.. 
 I really don't know how to help this times.

And for the Muslim. 

There is totally no indent at all. 

 Schedule for  out ration for ehance breakfast, boxes and bags are parked at Cookhouse but in the end  the 31 recruits dine in which actually FFC starts packing for your coy already...

06/07/2020, 12:25 - Tan Xin Kai: Actually exact and prescriptive distinction terms isn't helpful at all. In fact, many food cultures and heritage is intertwined and shared among countries like M'sia and S'pore since both shares many similar cultures and due to close proximity, it's not absurd at all to consider food culture in this region to be a continuum
06/07/2020, 12:26 - Tan Xin Kai: That's what I wanna say.. like hard exact terms to differentiate between what is _pure_ or _authentic_ versions of food in Malaysia or Singapore isn't helpful categorisation, if it's even needed at all
06/07/2020, 12:28 - Tan Xin Kai: It just happen that which of these foods or versions got popular in which regions... Then the respective communities felt attached to their local versions of food there

06/07/2020, 12:29 - Wh: So its chinese food
06/07/2020, 12:29 - Tan Xin Kai: Yet Sporeans feel attached to it as it's "made local"
06/07/2020, 12:29 - Tan Xin Kai: It's intertwined

• When turning out go with half door else mount kerb

Parking (Verticle):
• Line up in middle of lane/ near to middle of road
• Don't turn wheel while stationary***
• No more than 3 min
• Confirm safety (lights -> check right/back) 
• Stop at sign then check if back stripe hits ard 0.75 bar 
• Check back again after straighten wheel
• Do not open door
• Remember to adjust back mirror after parked***** (P then hand brake)
• When go out 1 door length for verticle
• If not perfect can release wheel a bit until front wheel past kerb then straighten by full lock (also can drive forward but waste time)
• If not perfect put to D then straighten wheel a bit then reverse until okay then full lock
• The s course area is 3/4 from kerb, crank course 3/4 from bumps

Parking (Parallel):
• Line up like kerb side stopping 
• No turn wheel whilst stationary 
• Confirm safety ( 3x) 
• 5 mins max 
• Initial position depends on location (some mirror touches sign, middle door handle at front touches kerb)
• Check when initial reverse
• Signal left & check + adjust mirrors
• Full lock left until mirror see 1 bar
• Check then reverse while wheel straighten till rear wheel touches line
• Full lock right, check, reverse more till car straighten.
• Center the car
• Go off: return mirror, check & signal, move car back, full lock right.
• Wait until behind car park finish
• Park in centre of space, dont reverse too back later hit kerb
• If cannot straighten by reverse, straighten by going forward
• Driving wheel must be straighten when parked (arbitary)
• Tip of the front door handle touches the front kerb**
Slope:
(Check dir of signals)
• Move to stop line and stop, hand-brake 
• Signal left + check right (direction vice versa)
• Signal right (vv.), Hand brake down, step on accelerator 
• Immediately switch signal to direction you want to go (if change lane to right don't need change signal)
• When there is another car beside you, if he go in first need to let him move first, you move after the car moves, pan head towards the other side of the lane to signal checking
Reverse up ramp:
• Rmb to check safety
• Same technique as dir. change, full lock right aft coming down initially
• When go in, go in mid (positioning)
• Hit ramp break
• Then go up one shot (technique - slowly increase acceleration, break when car is up)
• Hard break
• Check reverse, go reverse gear
• Cushion Brake when coming down 
• Check reverse again then full lock to right, reverse in.
• Straighten while reverse (2pts)
Emergency stop: 
• Technique = step super hard on break, hold wheel firm
• Signal right to move off then check then return signal

Signal:
• 2 free for wrong signals/didnt cancel signals in circuit

*Road*

Free points:
• 1 delay in moving off
• 1 insufficient acceleration
• 1 fail to overtake when necessary
• 1 unnecessary stopping
• 1 incorrect positioning @ junction 
• 1 improper turning at wide & sharp turn
• 2 fail to check blind spot
• 1 fail to check mirror before slowing down & turning
• 1 fail to check mirror before change lane/ overtaking
• 1 fail to apply break when stationary 
• 1 signal at wrong time, wrong signal & cancel signal
Notes:
• Keep left
• Overtake if bus/car stops (dont need to if the other lane is full -- safety)
• Lane change cannot occur abruptly
• Side clearance to cyclist/objects (can slowly pass-by cyclist)
• Adjust mirror bef driving
• Braking technique
• While overtaking, can force by slowly
• Route 10 very rare also heavy traffic plus got highway exit need to watch out
• U-turn via shoulders but make sure to not miss it
• No sudden acceleration when suddenly light turns yellow - dangerous to side road users
• Only accelerate when overtaking when applicable 
• Try to inch (release break) after stop at stop line to see if there is traffic or not
• Inch only when no car/ confident turning
• Observation is very impt (T junction, motorcyclist, distance of car behind)
• One of the route no need to keep left (all parking space) (teck whee) 
• Check for pedestrian (for right turn especially.)
• Slow turning = can turn into correct lane (for left turns)
• Slow speed = less errors
• Keep centre of lane
• Don't follow car too closely later cannot stop before stop line
• Speed maintain around 40-45 anything else is too slow/ too fast
• If going to industrial road: keep left only after the hump, else keep right before hump
• When green light turns red, release break before green arrow turns on
• Do not cross central divider, if can't go in take your time
• Give way to turning traffic also especially when right turning
• U turn when sudden heavy traffic (heavy trucks) needs to cease opportunity else very hard
• Cannot be too slow and ponder around when lane changing
• Course number 7 one part at landed can keep right when gonna turn right & cannot keep left
• Go on Amber light else IF since hard breaking is dangerous
• First in Junction check right and left/ mirror

E-break:
• Hold firm steering wheel and step hard on brake, confirm safety when moving off (blindspot), signal right to move off when its safe
Steering Wheel:
• When reversing, the vehicle response to the steering wheel is not as sensitive as when you are driving forward. tendency to oversteer when reversing.
Handbrake:
• Only use on slopes/parking
Side mirror adjustment:
• Adjust the side mirror until the horizon is slightly above the centre line. Part of the body of your vehicle should be seen in the mirror.
Blind spots:
• changing lane, overtaking and turning.
Correct braking:
• Depress early Depress hard Reduce pressure gradually
Negotiating bend:
• Before bend, slow down. At bend, accelerate
CHANGING LANES
• estimation of speed and distance of vehicles approaching from behind before (beside) car
• checks: mirrors, signal, blindspot
• Slow down to let (beside) car pass / speed up to pass (beside) car (depends on position, speed etc.)
• When it is safe, accelerate smoothly and steer gently into the lane intended whilst looking in front (beware of front car stopping)
• Only cross centre lane when got obstacles

25/08/2020, 11:22 - Tan Xin Kai: What
25/08/2020, 11:57 - Wh: On 1 March 1964, the People’s Action Party (PAP) announced that it would be sending a token team of candidates to contest the upcoming Malaysian general election to be held on 25 April. The PAP’s objective was to establish itself as a national Malaysian party to fight the anti-Malaysian parties so as to ensure the success of the Federation of Malaysia.[1] The PAP contested nine parliamentary seats but only managed to win the Bangsar seat.[2]The PAP’s participation in the general election caused a political uproar in Kuala Lumpur. Tunku Abdul Rahman, then the Malaysian Prime Minister, saw the contest as a political challenge and an attempt by the PAP to intervene in federal politics.[3] Subsequently, the winning PAP candidate and the rest of the Singapore representatives were branded as opposition in the federal parliament, and Lee Kuan Yew, then the Prime Minister of Singapore, was offered the post of leader of the opposition.[4] Although Lee declined the offer, he highlighted in his first post-election speech in the federal parliament that Kuala Lumpur’s communal approach to politics might not be conducive in the long-term for promoting racial unity. He was of the view that the federal government should look to the PAP for new directions so as to better integrate the races. In response, the Tunku made it clear to Lee that the PAP should confine its role to Singapore and devote its energy to turn the island into “the New York of South East Asia”. In exchange, the Tunku assured Lee that his Alliance party would not interfere in the affairs of Singapore.[5]However, extremists within the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party did not agree to such a compromise. They launched a smear campaign against the PAP, accusing Lee and his government of mistreating the Malays in Singapore, and depriving them of the special rights enjoyed by their counterparts in Malaysia. The extremists used a combination of fiery language and appeals in Malay newspapers and rallies to stir up sentiment within the Malay community in Singapore.[6] It was believed that the tense atmosphere created by the smear campaign led to the eventual outbreak of communal riots in Singapore on 21 July and 2 September 1964.

26/10/2020, 15:20 - Tan Xin Kai: Dear Sirs and All, 

Several key messages regarding the technical pause of the annual influenza vaccination exercise (AIVE) 2020. 

*Background:* 
There have been recent news reports on South Korea’s National influenza vaccination effort, where several individuals have been vaccinated had died. While there has been no direct causal link between the deaths and the vaccine, in view of these reports, SAF has decided to take a precautionary approach and call a pause on the AIVE 2020 while further investigations by MOH are ongoing. 

Key messages to note: 
1.	*The technical pause on AIVE is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of our service personnel.* 
While there has been no evidence so far to suggest direct links between the deaths in South Korea and the vaccines used, more information is currently being gathered to conduct as assessment of the situation before further decisions are made.
2.	*AIVE is done regularly and in line with national vaccination guidelines.* 
It is not a new initiative. The intent is to prevent spread of influenza in our work and camp environment. Given the COVID-19 context, flu vaccination becomes even more crucial for optimal protection especially when symptoms of influenza and COVID-19 are similar. 
3.	*Your Health and well-being are of upmost importance.* 
Thus far, there have been no reports of any adverse effects following vaccinations in SAF. SAF will continue to monitor the situation closely. Please also continue to monitor your health closely and seek immediate medical attention if feeling unwell. 

Additional points to note for vaccinated individuals:  
1.	Possible side effects after vaccination include mild side effects such as local skin reactions (rash, redness), fever, joint/muscle aches, flu symptoms. If you do feel unwell after any vaccination, please report sick and inform him of your symptoms/recent vaccination. 
2.	There is no need to seek medical attention if you are well, and do not have symptoms. You may proceed with your regular daily activities as per normal, including physical activities. 
3.	As per prevailing COVID-19 measures, please continue monitoring your temperature, be mindful of symptoms of ARI, and seek medical attention if you feel unwell.

26/11/2020, 06:11 - Wh: Maybe u can try that?

26/11/2020, 06:11 - Wh: Yeah lah but at least u can speak
26/11/2020, 06:11 - Tan Xin Kai: And it has steep learning curve
26/11/2020, 06:12 - Wh: U should try it out nonetheless
26/11/2020, 06:12 - Tan Xin Kai: That's a slippery slope
26/11/2020, 06:12 - Wh: Lol
26/11/2020, 06:13 - Tan Xin Kai: Cus who killed it? Or rather if u want to nitpick... Who accelerated or causes dialects to go downslope quicker

26/11/2020, 06:25 - Tan Xin Kai: As said low numbers may not make it sustainable
26/11/2020, 06:25 - Wh: Why not
26/11/2020, 06:25 - Tan Xin Kai: Rather introduction of some programmes

26/11/2020, 06:27 - Wh: Lol
26/11/2020, 06:27 - Tan Xin Kai: Or u can have the other side leaning more towards the academic study of dialects
26/11/2020, 06:28 - Tan Xin Kai: Like it's syntax or vocab or grammar

02/12/2020, 11:32 - Tan Xin Kai: Although the production of meat may be ethical, i.e. no killing or less wastage, it's ultimately still flesh and meat
02/12/2020, 11:33 - Tan Xin Kai: I know Buddhism, according to my meagre knowledge, they don't eat meat due to reasons like to prevent causing harm and pain or sufferings to other life beings
02/12/2020, 11:33 - Tan Xin Kai: That's why onion and garlics are prohibited too since it kills some bacteria
02/12/2020, 11:34 - Wh: But the meat is not alive

02/12/2020, 11:37 - Tan Xin Kai: According to my knowledge, Buddhism preaches abt reducing or avoiding hearing or causing sufferings to other beings... Which means something like causing pain
02/12/2020, 11:37 - Tan Xin Kai: Since plants are also living things

HFT systems development

CCA leader


Financial literacy and investment

Outdoor exploration


My proudest achievement over the past few years is working as a software engineer at a high frequency trading firm. I was a full-stack developer, working on components that directly interface with the exchange and building a monitoring system to track profit and loss from their trading activities. Through this experience, I have picked up valuable skills in designing and developing software solutions, and I wish to offer my technical expertise to the college.

In JC, I was the chairman of the economics and finance club. I initiated many activities, such as an economic bubble simulation game to help my members better understand the cyclical nature of our economy. I was glad that I could make a difference in the lives of my members by improving their financial literacy, so that they can better navigate our world which is run by money. At RVRC, I wish to lead something similar, but on a bigger scale. In JC, the programs I conducted were limited to the members of my club, but I wish to organize community outreach programs in college. I want more people, especially those coming from a disadvantaged background, to have the skills and knowledge to plan their financial lives as well.

Lastly, I want to participate in outdoor exploration activities. As a nature lover, I am a firm believer in sustainability and an appreciation of our natural world. Interest groups like Green Ranger and RV Explorer appeal to me, and I look forward to being part of them.

These technologies pique my interest and formed my motivation for the pursue of computing and mathematical knowledge. 

Despite my passion, I rarely do sign up for competitions as I had a fear of failure. However, my friend persuaded me to participate in the Fastest Finger Graphing Calculator Competition. To my surprise, it turned out to be a great decision. During the preliminary round, I came out on top of the rest of the team in terms of individual score. I realise that the reason is due to my religious dedication to everything that I do. That is also the reason why I am able to maintain rather long study preparation sessions in one go. 

The discipline I get from studying is due to the fact that I am from one of the toughest scouts' unit. From my experience, most of the training we had in scouts was way tougher than what I had experienced in Basic Military Training during my National Service. I often contemplate to quit, but did not as I am dedicated to the organisation. The strict discipline and high standards are how my formation is able to obtain the Gold Frank Cooper Sands Award. 

At the finals, even though we had prepared amply, we are still bested. I realise that there will always be people who are better than you, and participating in competitions is a good way to gauge the gap in my knowledge. Through the competition, I have learned how to come up with mathematical solutions efficiently and effectively. With that, I am more prepared in utilising the new skills in the upcoming examinations.   

Of course, that is not my first competition. In my pastime, I am obsessed with history. To this date, whenever I am free, I will still be reading Wikipedia on historical events. In my secondary school days, the teacher took notice of me and put me with a group of students to form the humanities society. The club does participate in multiple competitions and organise activities that teaches the public about the nature and our heritage. 

One of the most memorable competition is the International History Bee and Bowl. It was the first such ventures by our school as we are the first ever team to compete. We had no idea what it was going to be like. However, we managed to answer enough questions correctly to be promoted to the semi-finals in Thailand. However, we did not actualise that trip as we lack funds to travel there. 

In a nutshell, in this highly developed nation, I am given a chance to pursue many of my different passion, to face my fear of failure and to have a shot in participating various competitions. As Georg Hegel once said “Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without passion.” I hope I will be given the opportunity to further enrich my passions.

03/05/2021, 13:06 - Wh: Hello stop ignoring
03/05/2021, 13:08 - Wh: For rvrc, its a 15 minutes solo interview with 2 interviewers. They will usually ask standard questions like talk about yourself, why rvrc, how does rvrc's theme of sustainability and environmental stewardship complement your major, how do you intend to contribute to rvrc, etc. Do expect other types of questions to be asked, eg qns about your hobbies and interests. I  suggest reading their website as they might ask if you know the requirements for their modules(?) yeah! :)
03/05/2021, 13:25 - Wh: RVRC is basically an old hall refurbished as an RC. Worse facilities (not in UTown), no aircon, really hot rooms (I’ve slept there for two nights and it was terrible), not tall enough for good views, drama regarding discipline (I think resolved now?) and all in all a set of modules that don’t interest a lot of people. But at the same time, no one I know from RVRC has ever complained to me about it, so I guess YMMV. It does feel cozy and chill, and their mods might be appealing to others!

Before the heavens entrust one with great responsibility, thy has to endure the torture of the mind, exhaustion of the physique and hunger of the body.
07/05/2021, 08:34 - Tan Xin Kai: Translation by netizens 1:
When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a great man,it always first frustrates his spirit and will,exhausts his muscles and bones,exposes him to starvation and poverty.
07/05/2021, 08:34 - Tan Xin Kai: Translation by netizens 2:
To be bestowed with great responsibility,one must be crucified with ordeal and tribulation so as to break one's will; subdue one's spirit; exhaust one's muscles; starve one's flesh.
07/05/2021, 08:38 - Wh: This one the best

08/05/2021, 23:19 - Wh: If you are paid late or not paid salary

Non-payment of salary is an offence.
Your employer must pay your salary on time, according to the terms of your employment contract.
If you are not paid on time, approach your employer to understand if there are reasons for the late payment, and whether the regular payment schedule can be resumed.
If you do not receive your salary, you can file an employment-related claim at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), or approach your union for assistance.

Smart casual will suffice, prepare answers related to sustainability (ie, things that you do to be sustainable, sustainable issues  that you know or want to find out more), or maybe why you like their curriculum or CCAs.

12/05/2021, 22:03 - Wh: Hey!  Adding on to the previous comment,  they also prefer a team Player or team leader sort rather than someone that plans to do things solo.So u gotta portray urself in that way if u want to pass the interview. They also asked me like how I wld plan or organise event in this covid/online situation/ how I can bring ppl close tgt. They will ask which sustainable issue is the most significant to u and why. These are the questions they asked me during my interview last year!  It's a very chill chit-chat session.  Good luck!

If we see such things happening, sadly for you we will “disband” your clique. Leads pls assist to enforce on this thanks.

16/05/2021, 10:53 - Tan Xin Kai: Not for young adulrs
16/05/2021, 10:53 - Tan Xin Kai: The Chairman: Mr Pritam Singh.

Mr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Madam. I thank the Ministers including Senior Minister Teo for sharing the more intricate details of the Green Plan. From an observer's perspective – a Singaporean looking at this – the targets are a very interesting part of the plan because with technology moving so quickly, I can imagine it is difficult to say when a certain thing can happen by.

I have got two questions. One was actually pertaining to a point with regard to the trade-offs that Senior Minister Teo alluded to in reply to Member Louis Ng's question about nuclear power. I recall seeing in the Government financial statements, a consultancy study that was done to study the prospect of the safe disposal of nuclear waste. And this was I think, a study that cost in excess of a $2 million. I can file a Parliamentary Question on this matter as to what were the findings of the Government, but certainly in terms of clean power, nuclear power that is a source that potentially should be looked at. So, it will be helpful to know what the Government's findings were in that regard. 

My second question is for Minister Desmond Lee. We read in the mainstream media allusions to how land, forested area should be dealt with, just like how we deal with our fiscal reserves, very carefully, with a second key, almost. My question is for the public to better understand the trade-offs, because it is a sensitive subject for the members of the public to have open areas and green lungs in the country, what sort of processes take place in Government to ensure that the trade-offs that are taken to, for example, remove a forested area, is a very careful one; and there are checks and balances in that process to make sure that all other alternatives have been considered carefully?

The Chairman: Senior Minister Teo.

Mr Teo Chee Hean: Could I just ask Mr Pritam Singh whether he is saying the Government should study nuclear power as an option? 

Mr Pritam Singh: Sir, I am not saying that because I do not have information on what could be the impact of that study or that proposal. But it would appear that the Government has looked into it, so it would be helpful to know what the Government's position is. 

The Chairman : Senior Minister Teo.

Mr Teo Chee Hean: The Government's position on nuclear power is quite clear and we have said so several times. We are not foregoing this as a long-term option, and we do not give up any of the options that are available. However, we do not see the current generation or the coming, in fact, even one and a half generations down, of nuclear power plants as being suitable for deployment in Singapore. But we are keeping a very close eye on new developments in nuclear power plants to see whether sometime in the future, as their safety and their capabilities improve, with inherent safety of nuclear power plants, might make them viable or feasible for Singapore.

But we keep an open mind on this. We are looking even at nuclear fusion and tokamaks.

We also have to study, and I am not sure whether this is in fact the study that the Member had referred to. We fund a research centre for nuclear and nuclear safety in Singapore, in order to keep a watch on all these issues including nuclear safety. Although we may not develop a nuclear power plant in Singapore, our neighbours may well do so. So, we need to understand the safety implications of nuclear power plants within a certain radius of us.

The other thing which we need to be prepared for – and this may well be the subject of the study; I do not know which study Mr Pritam Singh is referring to – is that we need to be prepared for nuclear contamination in Singapore, either through a nuclear accident somewhere in the region or by deliberate action, say a terrorist action with a dirty bomb. We have to look at how we clean up such a device or such nuclear radioactive substances that have been dispersed in Singapore, say by terrorist action – how we collect them and how we clean them up. We actually have plans for such a thing. We have to think ahead and we do have plans for this. This may well be what Mr Pritam Singh was thinking. I do not know because I do not know the specific reference.
