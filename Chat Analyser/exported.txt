18/07/2020, 19:47 - Illays: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.

31/08/2020, 06:39 - Illays: I don't think it's a copout, but rather an assertion that computer science isn't software engineering, it isn't programming -- it's, well, the science of formalized computation. In essence, it's math (in fact, many CS programs started off as applied mathematics programs).

I think the problem lies more with industry than academia. Industry sees a CS degree listed on a résumé and thinks, "Great, this guy's good with computers," and hires him to do anything related to a computer: IT, programming, software development, whatever. Those things don't necessarily lie in the realm of expertise of a CS graduate. In turn, a lot of people who like building computers or playing videogames enter a CS program expecting to do that kind of stuff, and get a rude surprise; i.e., a lot of students going into CS don't really belong there, and would be better off in a more targeted degree program.

Secondly, there's a very limited time to teach CS -- a very broad subject -- in a typical undergraduate curriculum. My undergrad curriculum had 8 CS courses (for a BA) or 12 CS courses (for a BS), plus all the required math courses. That's not a lot of time to teach CS and math and programming and software engineering, so at some point you have to decide what's important, and what a student can pick up on their own.

That last point is crucial: I think a good student -- in any subject area -- will explore ideas on their own. I have a CS degree, but I think I came out of college as a decent developer, because I studied and wrote software on my own. College isn't all about classes; it's also about giving students time to develop their skills semi-autonomously, while still giving valuable guidance.

I maintain that teaching theory -- CS, math, etc. -- is just as important, if not more important, than teaching specific job-related skills. If you teach a student the why behind methods and techniques, and not just the what, you'll end up with someone who is much more adaptable when applying his knowledge. For example, I went to a much-maligned "Java school" and thus was taught in Java, but I also had courses in programming language theory, which explained the why behind many languages; as a result, I've learned to write much better software than if I didn't have that background. Sure, I don't write software in Haskell in my day job, but knowing a lot of programming language theory has allowed me to gain insight that has been applicable to my job as a programmer.

I also think industry is expecting too much from college students. Industry wants to cut its own costs, so instead of training new recruits for their jobs, they expect colleges to become trade/technical schools; in effect, they want colleges to do their training for them. College graduates can't be expected to know everything fresh out of college. Being a good developer is as much about experience as it is about knowledge (especially in a relatively young field like software development).

09/09/2020, 19:21 - Illays: They got lucky but they volunteered to go so
09/09/2020, 19:21 - Wh: Lol
09/09/2020, 19:21 - Illays: My 6 days was 6 days
09/09/2020, 19:21 - Wh: Well least you got time to prepare for yours
09/09/2020, 19:22 - Illays: Mean if u went for outfields last time then u won't have to go now
09/09/2020, 19:22 - Wh: I can't control that one what
09/09/2020, 19:23 - Wh: Also I did told markus about my problem so there's that
09/09/2020, 19:23 - Illays: Precisely so he didn't send u for outfields
09/09/2020, 19:24 - Illays: Bit unfair to other signallers then
09/09/2020, 19:24 - Wh: He did but for the shorter ones
09/09/2020, 19:24 - Illays: Unless ur doing armskote then everyone gotta split the outfield workload
09/09/2020, 19:38 - Wh: Long rant ahead, skip to TLDR if you too tired to read.

Ok not gonna lie I feel unhappy about this time sudden outfield which is why I am complaining so much but to you may seem fair but to me I consider my health more so I may not see the same way as you did, thats just my view. I did more than my fair share in Taiwan as ISO signaller so maybe thats why I am feeling that I did my fair share of outfield which balanced out but now I am doing more especially going to ord soon. 

P.S. This is my feeling, I apologise if you are upset by this even though I acknowledge that you are just doing your job, but I need to voice out my opinion to make myself at ease.

On top of that doing logistics is also quite taxing especially audit coming soon and I was expecting to be treated like a discount armskote guy and getting a discount on outfield days?

TLDR: 
Again I must apologise if I offend you, I believe your system is right on paper but not including contributions on other area is another reason I am upset 😔
09/09/2020, 19:39 - Illays: Btw, for cz and qb oil for big cat, I wanted to shorten it coz they ended earlier but I asked Adithya and he said just leave it.
09/09/2020, 19:40 - Wh: I agree with Aditya leave it be
09/09/2020, 19:41 - Wh: They are doing a lot of days of outfield on paper but in reality it covers wfh period
09/09/2020, 19:45 - Illays: I didn't take Overseas exercises into account in this but I see where you're coming from. The seniors also went through it and like GT he was iso twice I heard and Aloy too but they just go about their job.

If I was the ic, I would handle it differently and make sure everyone went out same days. Also tbf vinesh and ashraf that time had to stay overnight for a couple of days. But they just do it, it's part of our job.
09/09/2020, 19:50 - Illays: Also I wasn't upset or anything...
09/09/2020, 19:51 - Illays: This is also prolly your last and only long outfield
09/09/2020, 19:51 - Illays: So no need to think too much
09/09/2020, 19:52 - Wh: No lah I still salty about the iso job
09/09/2020, 19:52 - Wh: I a bit scared of him especially
09/09/2020, 19:52 - Wh: To be with him takes courage no other roles need
09/09/2020, 19:52 - Wh: Lol
09/09/2020, 19:52 - Illays: Bruh that's like January
09/09/2020, 19:52 - Illays: Aloy told me he just sleeps in the car
09/09/2020, 19:52 - Illays: You don't have to man comms even right
09/09/2020, 19:53 - Illays: The iso driver should be the worst
09/09/2020, 19:55 - Wh: Bruh me vs aloy
09/09/2020, 19:56 - Wh: You think I will sleep in the car meh I was awake all night one
09/09/2020, 19:56 - Wh: Aloy cause he don't scared of iso lah
09/09/2020, 20:05 - Illays: Why were u scared of him ...
09/09/2020, 20:05 - Illays: Idm man but that's like 8 months ago

09/09/2020, 20:07 - Wh: My powerbank died
09/09/2020, 20:07 - Illays: I wanted to pass u my powerbank yesterday....

24/10/2020, 08:00 - Illays: Yeah. But I'm not afraid of this too much.
24/10/2020, 08:00 - Illays: More of the anaesthesia part
24/10/2020, 08:00 - Wh: I think they will give you painkillers
24/10/2020, 08:00 - Wh: You should ask for more
24/10/2020, 08:01 - Illays: Lol
24/10/2020, 08:01 - Wh: Yeah
24/10/2020, 08:02 - Wh: Ask for morphine

24/10/2020, 08:03 - Wh: So just apply will do
24/10/2020, 08:03 - Illays: I mean if the pain is overwhelming
24/10/2020, 08:04 - Wh: It is lol
24/10/2020, 08:05 - Wh: use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (always read and follow the manufacturer's dosage instructions) – there's some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen is the best painkiller to take after having wisdom teeth removed. avoid strenuous activity and exercise for a few days.
24/10/2020, 08:06 - Illays: Basically u just have to let it bleed and don't rinse ur mouth so it'll heal faster
24/10/2020, 08:07 - Wh: Nah
24/10/2020, 08:07 - Wh: avoid strenuous activity and exercise for a few days

use an extra pillow to support your head at night

for 24 hours, avoid rinsing, spitting, hot drinks or anything else that may dislodge the blood clots that form in the empty tooth socket (they help the healing process)

avoid smoking and drinking alcohol for 24 hours 

eat soft or liquid food for a few days and chew with your other teeth

gently rinse the extraction site with antiseptic mouthwash after 24 hours, and repeat this regularly over the next few days, particularly after eating – you can also use warm water with a teaspoon of salt as mouthwash to reduce gum soreness and inflammation
24/10/2020, 08:08 - Illays: Yah wat I said, don't rinse ur mouth
24/10/2020, 08:09 - Illays: They gave me this information slip
24/10/2020, 08:09 - Wh: Lol
24/10/2020, 08:14 - Wh: Complications and risks

A number of more serious complications are associated with general anaesthetics, but these are rare.
Possible serious complications and risks include:

a serious allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (anaphylaxis)

waking up during your operation – the amount of anaesthetic given will be continuously monitored to help ensure this does not happen

death – this is very rare, occurring in around 1 in every 100,000 cases
24/10/2020, 08:14 - Wh: Hmmmmmm
24/10/2020, 08:24 - Illays: Yeah which is why I'm more scared of anaesthesia part
24/10/2020, 08:24 - Illays: But friend did on general anesthesia and he said it was nothing
24/10/2020, 08:25 - Wh: Lol
24/10/2020, 08:25 - Wh: Different people different reactions
24/10/2020, 08:25 - Illays: But for me idk how effective it is on me coz I'm a very awake kind of person 😆
24/10/2020, 08:25 - Illays: If I don't fall asleep they'll have to cancel the surgery
24/10/2020, 08:25 - Illays: Or increase the dosage which is not desirable
24/10/2020, 08:25 - Wh: 72000 people in the world died due to anesthesia
24/10/2020, 08:25 - Wh: You still want to do it?
24/10/2020, 08:26 - Illays: I already signed the form...

24/10/2020, 08:26 - Wh: Why not general?

16/05/2021, 12:56 - Illays: For my shopee interviews I actually only did like 3 leetcode problems
16/05/2021, 12:56 - Wh: Lol wow nice
16/05/2021, 12:56 - Illays: To prepare 😅
16/05/2021, 12:57 - Illays: Coz it was a frontend role so I didn't anticipate very algorithmic questions
16/05/2021, 12:57 - Wh: Btw when you start working for shoppee?
16/05/2021, 12:57 - Illays: Iet me recall some of the questions if I can remember
16/05/2021, 12:58 - Illays: I was only told within 2 weeks they will prepare an offer so not confirmed yet
16/05/2021, 12:58 - Wh: Lol
16/05/2021, 12:59 - Illays: I can only remember the last question I was asked and that's prolly the toughest but not that tough in many people's eyes I think 😅
16/05/2021, 13:00 - Illays: Let me type it out
16/05/2021, 13:05 - Illays: In my own words

Give a list of back-to-back search queries. A pair represents 2 search queries. The second query is done after the first search query. So they have an "association".

So list looks like this

const searches = 
[
["Bag", "Wallet"],
["Wallet", "Toy"],
["Pen","Knife"],
["Handbag","Toy"],
["Lipstick","Handbag"],
["Handbag","Bag"]
]

write a function that checks if a path exists from one keywords to the other

functions pathExists(keyword1, keyword2)
16/05/2021, 13:06 - Illays: pathExists returns boolean
16/05/2021, 13:07 - Illays: I think there must be a leetcode question like this out there
16/05/2021, 13:08 - Wh: lol
16/05/2021, 13:09 - Wh: what do you mean path exist?
16/05/2021, 13:09 - Illays: The question wasn't phrased that way btw. I don't remember what was asked so I paraphrased
16/05/2021, 13:10 - Illays: If there's a link between 2 keywords
16/05/2021, 13:10 - Wh: <Media omitted>
16/05/2021, 13:10 - Wh: They adv jobs on their site
16/05/2021, 13:10 - Illays: Hackerrank?
16/05/2021, 13:10 - Wh: yea
16/05/2021, 13:11 - Illays: You've tried both leetcode and hackerrank?
16/05/2021, 13:11 - Wh: no hacker rank only
16/05/2021, 13:11 - Wh: leet code for pro
16/05/2021, 13:11 - Wh: hacker rank for beginners
16/05/2021, 13:11 - Illays: Hmm I don't think so
16/05/2021, 13:11 - Wh: wym
16/05/2021, 13:12 - Illays: I think both are the same. My experience is that leetcode questions are vetted more if that makes sense
16/05/2021, 13:12 - Wh: Hmm
16/05/2021, 13:13 - Wh: But leetcode u have to pay
16/05/2021, 13:14 - Illays: Yeah I don't. I only tried the free questions. Should try both. But ultimately I think check the reviews/stars before doing a question 😁
16/05/2021, 13:14 - Wh: <Media omitted>
16/05/2021, 13:15 - Illays: Yeah I wonder who has that much time on their hands
16/05/2021, 13:15 - Wh: A person who wants to get into Google?
16/05/2021, 13:15 - Wh: Lol
16/05/2021, 13:16 - Wh: Or me
16/05/2021, 13:16 - Illays: Lol
16/05/2021, 13:16 - Illays: True
16/05/2021, 13:16 - Illays: Then u can solve the leetcode problems. Go from ez to hard
16/05/2021, 13:17 - Wh: Nah I stick with hackerrank first
16/05/2021, 13:17 - Wh: Their hard problem is basically unsolvable lol
16/05/2021, 13:17 - Illays: Yeah...
16/05/2021, 13:18 - Illays: Which is why I left 😂
16/05/2021, 13:18 - Wh: Wow
16/05/2021, 13:18 - Wh: Technically you could get the answers rather easily unlike in leetcode where you need to pay to get answwrs
16/05/2021, 13:19 - Illays: I didn't even understand the answers. Let me try to find the problem I last solved.
16/05/2021, 13:19 - Wh: Ok put me up to the challenge lol
16/05/2021, 13:19 - Wh: Btw you can use different languages to solve a single problem, which is what I like
16/05/2021, 13:19 - Illays: I think I wasted a lot of time on it
16/05/2021, 13:19 - Illays: So not worth. Interviews aren't gonna ask that question, I just tried out of fun
16/05/2021, 13:20 - Illays: Same for all platforms

28/05/2021, 10:22 - Illays: Oh...
28/05/2021, 10:27 - Illays: same as this?
28/05/2021, 10:27 - Illays: https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/
28/05/2021, 10:28 - Wh: Similar but not the same
28/05/2021, 10:28 - Illays: Nani
28/05/2021, 10:28 - Wh: This one locked the main and the node code
28/05/2021, 10:28 - Wh: So you must use their code
28/05/2021, 10:32 - Wh: I think there's 3 variables
28/05/2021, 10:32 - Wh: The node, the key and the value
28/05/2021, 10:33 - Wh: The node is the position of the key in the cache
28/05/2021, 10:33 - Wh: While the key has its value?
28/05/2021, 10:55 - Wh: anyways from web search, theres 2 ways of solving this, one is to use the pointer method, the other is the deque mtd
28/05/2021, 10:56 - Wh: struct Node {
    Node* next;
